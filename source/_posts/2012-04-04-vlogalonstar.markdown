Good evening! It's the 4th of April and welcome! This is... new for me.

If you've ever been to avalonstar.com before---my blog---it should be weird because you've never seen *this* on Avalonstar before. This is an experiment for me. Let me tell you what it's about and get to the point.

So, in 2005 I had a podcast called "Live From the 101." There was this great service called Odeo. They had a cell phone feature where you could just talk and record a podcast on the way home from work. So that's what I did. I had brought in my best friend, Dan Rubin, to host with me. The only problem with those was---while I miss them---they were too long. They went from 30 to 45 minutes to an hour. We had a lot to talk about, but we just couldn't stop talking.

So fast forward to today. A few years ago, Jen, my wife, had found the [Vlogbrothers][1]. The Vlogbrothers are this duo of *brothers* on YouTube who communicate with each other via vlog posts. The inspirational thing about them is their format. Their format has always been 5 minute long videos. If they ever gone past 5 minutes, the other brother would punish them for going over. It's been a pleasure to watch them and---again---they've been an inspiration for doing *this* in *this format*. They talk about a lot of great things from politics, to science, to honey badgers.

I thought to myself:

> Well, since I relaunched Avalonstar, even though I have a lot to talk about now, I don't always want to write it. Sometimes I just want to talk---to speak---face-to-face.

As face-to-face as this can get.

What I want to do with it is keep 5 minute videos of blabbering about things that range from design, development... J-pop even.

I have a short list of topics that I want to talk about. I hope to do this 2 to 3 times a month, depending on the environment. Usually it's pretty crazy around here so we'll see what we can do. If you have any ideas for topics, please feel free to let me know.

This is going to be an interesting experience. It's something I've never done before. I've wanted to go back to my roots---communicating and talking. I am hoping this'll help me. I am not very adept at talking to a camera, or to people, or to the Internet for that matter. When you put me in a one-on-one conversation, I'm actually pretty good at that. So I'm hoping to bring that part of me here and hopefully you guys can see that sooner or later. I hope this isn't only practice for me, but an interesting journey for all of us.

Where will this take us? We'll see.

With that, if there's any luck out there, send it my way since I'll probably need it. But other than that, take care and I will see you next time!
