I couldn't help but notice on the [JoshuaInk][1] mailing list that they started to talk about [Faruk Ates][2] (KuraFire) and where his name came from. Frankly, [when I read his entry][3], I was enlightened, because I love to see how people develop their names (as long as it's not XxCrA8zy4ZNofD00MxX, etc.). In addition, Faruk exemplified his pet peeve of having KuraFire spelled or capitalized incorrectly.

> However, something that truly gets under my skin is when the nickname KuraFire isn't properly capitalized. This is not the fault of those who do that, mind you, it's just something that bugs me. Here's why.

This has given me the chance to kick the rears of all those who have added an extra space where there shouldn't be one. ;)

So I am going to go into depth as to how Avalonstar came about, and if you haven't heard the story before, I'm sure you think it'd be this long story about heroism and mythology. But actually, it isn't. It's rather... dull, to tell you the truth. Avalonstar has been called a catchy name and I believe somebody described how "it rolled off their tongue" way back when. Forgot who. Anyway, time to jump into this debacle.

So "avalon" as defined by the American Heritage Dictionary as the following:

avalon
:   In Arthurian legend, an island paradise in the western seas to which King Arthur went at his death.

Yeah, that's one definition. You can find a lot more if you search for it in [Wikipedia][4]. It's a town, it's a movie, it's pretty much the name of every other club you pass. Well, unfortunately none of the disambiguations or the above definition fit the story of where I got Avalon from. So you want to know where? [**This is where.**][5] Yes, out of **all** the definitions of and things named Avalon, I found out about it through Toyota's luxury full-size sedan.

With that said, I'm not going to even get into how I added "star" to it.

Now it's time to drop the bomb. **Avalonstar is one word.** There is no space, no underscore, no dash between the **N** and the **S**. The **S** should not be capitalized. Avalon is not possessive, so Avalon's Star isn't right either. Come on people, it's like seeing on the title bar that my name is spelled Br**y**an, and you spell it Br**i**an. I do believe that it was the CSS Vault that started the trend of separating the *avalon* and the *star*, but I hope this fixes it. Tsk, tsk. Naughty children.

My thanks go to [Faruk][2], for now another stone has been lifted off my chest.
