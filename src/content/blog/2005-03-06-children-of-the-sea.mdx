For #39, I couldn't help but post a memory of my trip to the Philippines, and if you look a the faces of my cousins in that picture I think that'll tell you how much fun I had. As my photostream will say, I really do miss those children and I wonder what they're up to now and what memories they're creating. I wonder if they'd remember me if they saw a picture or snicker if they heard me try to pronounce something in Visayan.

Someday - I'll see them again. Then they won't be children anymore. But at least I'll always have this picture.
