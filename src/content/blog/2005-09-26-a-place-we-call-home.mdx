For the past few months, I've been writing about the transition from the college life to the working world. For those of you who have been following along, it's been a pretty rough ride. However, the whole process has showed me two things.

1.  Great things come to those who wait.
2.  It's not only what you know, it's also who you know.

Pretty obvious sayings, but they're worth their weight in gold when applied to the real world. In case you haven't followed along, here's a small recap.

> After graduation I had planned on tapping into my entrepreneurship degree. Our plan at the time was for me to look for a job in Savannah, Georgia so Jen could attend SCAD. Sadly, nothing worked out while I was in Savannah, so I came back from a useless week-long trip pretty bummed out. My dad then asked me to try focusing on my hobby, design. With that, I ran into [Evan on][1] [Stylegala's forums][2], and he got me into [LinkedIn][3]. Using that service I found a potential offer at LinkedIn itself, so I traveled to Silicon Valley to meet my maker. After the interview I searched again, only to find [Facebook][4] as my other choice. So two hours before my flight back home, I met up with them. Two days later I received a phone call from Facebook and two days after that, I signed my life over to them (much to the dismay of LinkedIn). The rest, is pretty much redundant.
Now that you're all caught up. Let me tell you about the apartment and it's special inhabitants.

## The Apartment

After using [Backpack][5] to post our findings for about 30 apartments in the Silicon Valley area, we finally settled on an apartment complex in Downtown San Jose, the [Avalon at Cahill Park][6] (weird, isn't it?). Although it was a little more expensive to get this one, we worked hard. Needless to say, it was worth it. The Avalon is a four-story complex complete with amenities from a recreation room, fitness center and a hot tub. Regarding the apartment itself, it is a one bedroom flat with hardwood floors and berber carpet. Most of all it's very homelike, and the complex is very safe. In the beginning, it was their loft apartment that had attracted us, but unfortunately we were out of luck until December. Although whether or not we're getting it is still up in the air, at least we have a place in the meantime.

Here are some pictures for your optical pleasure:

## The Felines

During the past few weeks, I've wanted to introduce my beloved pets but haven't really had a good moment to. Also, until yesterday, Jen and I had two cats. It's needless to say that it was Jen that got me into pets, cats in particular. These first two have been a part of our lives for the past 14 months, and hopefully the last one will get used to being part of the family real soon.

### Ravyn

Ravyn is my first pet, and Jen's 3rd cat. Thanks to a friend, we picked Ravyn out of a litter of 3 and brought him home. Ravyn taught me the basics of being a pet owner, including all the perks (like having your bed peed on, etc.). Now, 15 months later, he's a strong and strapping young male. However, he can be the biggest wuss of the group and always has the capacity to whine. Oh well, can't raise them perfectly you know. As his "father" I wish he was the more protecting type, but it seems like he's more interested in opening kitchen cupboards than protecting anything.

### Willow

Willow is my "little girl". On my way back from work a year ago, I ran into a lady holding a 4-week-old kitten in her hand. Upon asking her where she was going, she offered me the cat, citing that her mom had run away. Without thinking twice, I took her and brought her in (surprising Jen after she got home from work). The rest is history. Willow started out as one of our weirdest cats, and she still is. Now, she just has a "princess" complex. She spends her days looking photogenic, and then hissing at the newbie below.

### Naida

Naida is our newest addition and also an impulse buy. A spunky 4-month-old domestic shorthair, Naida's given name was Sara, until we adopted her from a store in Los Angeles. We have no idea why we got her other than the fact that we saw an adoption sign and she was one of the cutest of the group. We also have no idea what's in store for her, but that's part of the fun.

So with that, this story is closed. Happy ending? I think so. Now, this isn't our final resting place but the beginning of a series of moves that could either keep us in the Silicon Valley area, or take us back to the east. Who knows? But I can tell you that not knowing is half the fun.
