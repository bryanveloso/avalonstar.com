So you're going see a lot of posts today about Google's new browser, [Chrome][1]. Apparently it's not finished, and if you're viewing this site in it, I suggest you don't, since it appears that [they've exchanged][2] `text-shadow` for `text-shitify`.

But we're not going to talk about that. No, you're not going to hear me go off about how it doesn't fit with the OS or how it fails at rendering rounded corners. No, we're going to talk about something much more substantial in the sprit of [talking about][3] [Google on Avalonstar][4]. Exhibit A please.
