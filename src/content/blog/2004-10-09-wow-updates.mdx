Did I ever mention that this was my first go at MovableType?

Well, after being blessed by my job and being able to print out the 79 page manual, I have finally been able to find some copies of my old writings. Those are now up in my "Writings" section. Thanks for the encouragement with the design, and remember there will be more than this. I'm not going to put a style switcher up if only one style really available.

I really hope that my brain starts working again and I can get back to the writing tablet. It has been a while since I wrote my last article, but I find that I respond better to questions or issues that are brought to my attention rather than trying to fry my brain trying to think about something myself. So if you have any ideas or would like to question me about some topic that you would like a second opinion on, I'll be happy to take some time to write about it.

On that note, I'm thinking of writing something long, something on either inspiration (since people like when I talk about that) or "business eye for the web design guy". Okay, it's 2:30, I'm done.
