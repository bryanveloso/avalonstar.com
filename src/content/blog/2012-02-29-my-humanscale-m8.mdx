I've been on a mounting spree as of late. First, my TV. Then my microphone. Now, my iMac. This, _[the Humanscale M8][1]_, is the last piece of the puzzle I alluded to in my [last post][2]. While I didn't have the best luck with actually getting it—it took me nearly a month to receive it since it was on backorder—it was definitely worth the wait.

In the spirit of practicing for my next endeavor, I took a timelapse of the installation.

If you're interested in getting your own M8, [do use Google to find it][3]. Unless you like torturing your wallet, you can get this for around $225 USD (Humanscale sells it for over $400).
