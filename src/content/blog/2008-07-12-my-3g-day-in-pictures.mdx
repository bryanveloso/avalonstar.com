Well, we all know what happened on yesterday. No need to reiterate, no need to explain. Some had good days, some had empty ones. My day started out pretty down, but the actual wait made it all better.

The great [bacon lover][1] [Mark Bixby][2] commented on my [day's set][3],

> This whole set is **so** good! Really captures the weird excitement/frustration/melancholy of the day!

So rather than blog about it, why not just show you the pictures? :)

**Aside**: I tried to use Slideshow Pro for this, but, I couldn't get it to work the way I wanted to without ripping my hair out. It's not a bad product, it just didn't work out this time. If it weren't for that, this would have been out earlier. I should learn to quit when I'm frustrated sometimes. :)
