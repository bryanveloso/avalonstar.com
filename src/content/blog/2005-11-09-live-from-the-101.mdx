Holy hell! What's going on here!? Hell has frozen over.

Yes kids, hell has frozen over, because I finally podcasted. Why? I don't know, I thought it would be fun really. So "Live From the 101" is my phonecast/podcast about random things, mostly things I would have otherwise posted in "Bryan's Wondering." [Here's what I wrote about it:][1]

> Drives to work are so quiet, especially if you don't carpool. "So why not do a podcast," I thought. I'm thinking this is one of the many variety shows on the podcastosphere, but I don't have dancing girls sitting next to me or anything like that. Just me, my laptop and my cell phone. I'm no radio personality, but I can sure talk up a storm. Come with me on my way to work and watch if I hit something.

So every morning and evening (if I have something to talk about), I'll be podcasting in this little Odeo channel. Today's [episode][2] was about [ramen][3], so if that gives you any indication of what this is all about, more power to you. I really wanted this to be fun for the most part. No, I didn't go out and get any wicked software and sound hardware, there's no music, just my Samsung cell phone. So, if you're ears aren't bleeding after you hear my 16-year-old voice (I'm 22 by the way), then throw me a topic to talk about. I'm sure I'll find *something* to say about it.
