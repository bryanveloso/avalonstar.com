Yeah, I know. It looks like crap. If you're reading this entry, I'm surprised the lack of style hasn't scared you away.

Three days before graduation and I have no idea what to write anymore. So you can declare the college countdown dead. In site news, as you can see, I'm trying. Through a few other sites, I've finally found a way to make the layout idea I have in my head work. So here I go on that one. You'll probably see things progress over the next few days, but once Friday hits, I can't work on it until at least Monday.

Come on, I need some motivation (as he blasts the trailer music from The Two Towers)!
