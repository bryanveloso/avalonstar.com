While Seattle is finally noticing that spring has arrived, albeit a month before summer starts, it's time for some spring cleaning. As for me, I just got back from a 14-day, 3-city travel stint that has completely stolen the energy out of me. Thankfully, June will be a month of no travel and one of "hopefully" a lot more activity here at Avalonstar. Still so many things I need to do, and the recent [WebVisions][1] conference in Portland was a welcome wake-up call to the things I still need to get to!

## So things I'll be doing?

* Consolidating my email accounts on Revyver's Google Apps account.
* Working on tweaks for Avalonstar (or 25.1).
* Building the next revision of Django Plugables.
* Yet another version of bryanveloso.com (the current one has grown old **very** quickly).
* Starting on a few of those *visual* blog posts I've talked about.
* Cleaning the damn house, and my damn desk. Yes, actual cleaning.
* Finding a way to stop the damn dust from settling.
