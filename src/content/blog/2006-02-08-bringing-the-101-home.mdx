[Back in November][1], I started a "carcast" that went by the name of "Live from the 101," in which I pretty much talked nonsense while on my way to and from work. The reason I started doing it? Well, I had wanted to give a bit of a different twist to an already popular medium (something I try to do with everything). It worked well, until I ran out of things to talk about. But before I go on, if you'd like to know what I talked about, [here's a list of the 12 casts that did make it out of my brain][2], and below are some of my favorites.

*   [Ramen (04:32)][3]
*   [Online and Offline Personas (03:47)][4]
*   [Fried Ricers (09:01)][5]
*   [Madness Methods (10:40)][6]
*   [Striving for the Best (06:04)][7]
*   [Stuck (09:32)][8]

Since I've gotten the RX-8, it's been harder to cast (and it's pretty obvious why). However, it's not something that I'd like to stop doing. But in doing that, I'll have to say bye to Odeo. What I'm planning to do is bring it to here and make it more of a weekly event. (Which makes me think if I should change the name or not.) Anyway, before I start up on this renewed journey through the airwaves, it's a good time to take a look and see what I should do differently. This is your chance to let me know what you'd like to see out of "The 101." As for what I'm planning - well, it won't just be me all the time. So let me know if you'd like to hear me talking about a certain subject or a certain somebody (or if you would just rather hear me rant).
