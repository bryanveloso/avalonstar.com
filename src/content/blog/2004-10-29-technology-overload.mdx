Well, if you think about it, I did get my iPod in 2-3 business days, it's just the fact that it came over the lovely International Date Line that messed the count up for me, because the plane gains a day when it crosses it from east to west. FedEx did a good job with the package, and thank you to the special Chinese worker that put this together. From Shanghai to Anchorage to Indianapolis to Warwick and then finally to me. I think I'm a little too excited about this, but if you saved for something for weeks on end and finally got it, wouldn't you be really happy?

That's not all the technology for today though. I'm going to get to paying off a few eBay auctions for a router (so I can play online on my PS2 while Jenni is on the net) and a TiVo, which I'm really excited about. I'm going to rape that pause button, and the fast forward button. Thank god, no more commercials, except those that were mandated when TiVo got sued by those damn advertisers. If you really want to get the most out of your advertising, **hire somebody compitent to do your commercials**. Why not hire [Team One][1], [808inc][2] or even [Brand New School][3]? Their commercials are actually fun to watch. Oh well, if commercials were actually well done for the most part, I wouldn't need something like TiVo.

And that as they say, is that. As you can clearly see, I can start an entry one way, and come out a completely different way when I end. So it goes.
