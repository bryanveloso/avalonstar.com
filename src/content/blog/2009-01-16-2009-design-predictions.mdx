I don't have any. Go figure. So, **surprise me**. I like leaving things open ended.

Well, we live in a world of speculators, people who love to try and beat the market before anything's actually happened. My hope for this year is to be surprised, again and again. *Surprise the speculators* and send the *rumor mills packing*. Try something new, [like Canvas][1]. Break out of that shell. Thrown on [some CSS3][2] with a [sprinkle of HTML5][3]. [Leave IE6 behind for good][4].

Oh, I can make one prediction though, albeit personal. You'll be seeing [those eggrolls soon][5] and a bunch more. I'm sure that'll please [certain eggroll addicts][6].
