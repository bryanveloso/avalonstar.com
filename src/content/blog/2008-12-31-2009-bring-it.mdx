[It's been a comeback year.][1] [It's been a life-changing year.][2] [It's been a historic year.][3] [It's been a crazy year.][4] [It's been a scary year.][5]

[Dan][6] and I, during one of our many talks in the past, discussed the importance of this year and how next year will be even better. In some ways, it's hard to tell that anything could be much better given our current global environment. In other ways, it's already going to be better than the last.

But for Dan and I, we agreed that 2008 was a year spent setting up for 2009. Now 2009's here. *Bring it on.* :)

Now with the *formalities* out of the way, I'll start off with this. From Jen and I and our 5 felines, have a **safe**, **joyous** and **very prosperous** New Year.  今年もよろしくお願いします! (I hope for your favour again in the coming year!)
