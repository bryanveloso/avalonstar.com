Just being in the top five (in any competition) is something I could have never dreamed of, but something I definitely hoped for. But I guess this is the beginning, and another thing to look forward to at my first SXSWi. I'm up against some awesome blogs, and I know it'll be a great competition. Wish us all luck, it's going to be one hell of a rush.
