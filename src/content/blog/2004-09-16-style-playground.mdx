I hope to further my knowledge of CSS and the different ways of using it through this site. I know I'm not the first to do it, but it's more of a personal journey so I can improve my abilities rather than a marketing ploy.

So simply, if you have any styles or "skin" ideas that you would like me to create, let me know through comments or the usual manners. I already have two styles in the works, and hopefully I'll be able to quickly do some more as the ideas come to me.
