Archive.org did something right for once. It kept images of logos I did from Version 12 (ChaoticSoul) of Avalonstar, so I decided the world see something that I _used_ to be able to do. Back in 2002, I was really big on making logos, so much so that I made 5 of those that you'll see below in one day. (Man, I miss those days when inspiration really ran free.) I believed the streak came to an end when I finally decided on using the Phoenix logo for Avalonstar. Ever since then, I haven't designed any logos because my style (and skill) doesn't seem to fit the demands of today.

At any rate, here's an image of all the logos I did (that didn't fall victim to the fatal hard drive crash of 2003). Granted, I did these 4-6 years ago, so they're not the best. ;) But I do still love a bunch of them.

+ Compass - I made this when Avalonstar turned 2.
+ NJFBLA.org - Just did this on a whim, I think they still use it over there.
