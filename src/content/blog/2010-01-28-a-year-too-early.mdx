The iPad. There's really only one thing I have to address on the morning after "everybody's a fucking Apple expert"-day. But first, this:

Remember the first iPod? Remember how much that did at launch? Remember the first iPhone? Remember how much that did at launch?

The iPhone didn't become a "thing" until the 3G came out, and the iPod... at _least_ not until the 4th generation one. Is this so much different? No. It's just that everybody and their dog is now an Apple expert, so the noise level is just deafening.

Here's my "one" thing, **they released it too early**.

Let's take away the fact that it's lacking external features (HDMI? Seriously?). The fact of the matter is, it's running iPhone 3.2. That's **THREE** dot 2. So _of course_ it won't do multitasking, _of course_ it won't do any of the other things your iPhone won't do because it's **not** a new major release of the software.

And this is the saddening point, you can't have "magical" software if it's the same damn thing everybody's already running. So with all the noise, this was just another shot in the foot for a product that will inevitably see it's stride in the next cycle or two--at least when SDK 4.0 comes out.

I never came into this expecting that the iPad would be "OMG PERFECT" out of the gate, but I at least wish they had waited until they had truly magical software to go with their magical hardware.

You really should have waited, Apple.
