Maybe I'm just sad, because I've been waiting a long time to get bryanveloso.com and a few days ago, that dream was taken from me by some [assholes][1]. Mike Davidson had [a great article about how to prevent the squatting of domains][2] when he was trying to acquire Newsvine, but sadly I read it **after** all of this happened.

But it's not like [GoDaddy][3] helped. Hindsight's always 20/20, so should I really have expected them to? No. But still, I paid for a service that didn't work, and got no refund for it. Just an email saying "sorry, we were too slow." Sure $18.95 is nothing to cry about, but if this happens often, why the hell do they have the service in the first place? I put enough trust in GoDaddy to grab that domain for me and **then** I found out that there was little or no chance that I'd get it anyway. I'd understand if I was fighting for it with another Bryan Veloso, but I wasn't.

Well, before I go on my daily rampage, I'll just let GoDaddy do the talking.

    Dear Bryan Veloso,

    This notification is generated automatically as a service to you because you subscribe to DomainAlert(R).

    We will be attempting to secure the following domain name(s) you backordered:

    BRYANVELOSO.COM

    We will do this automatically -- no need for you to take any action or respond to this email.

    If you no longer want us to secure this domain name, and it is a .COM or .NET name, you have until 10:00 a.m. MST on 05/29/2006 to re-assign the backorder credit. If the name is a .BIZ or .US, you have until 9:00 a.m. MST. For .ORG and .INFO names, the time you have available to re-assign the backorder credit can change without notice. There is generally a 24- to 48-hour period in which we can release your originally chosen name.

*** Bryan's excited.**

    DOMAIN BACKORDER NOTIFICATION

    Dear Bryan Veloso,

    This notification is generated automatically as a service to you because you subscribe to DomainAlert(R).

    We're sorry, but the following domain name(s) that you backordered was not captured successfully:

    BRYANVELOSO.COM

    Changes made to a domain take at least 24 hours to update in the WhoIs database. If you perform a WhoIs lookup on the domain to verify registration information or the status of the domain before 24 hours has passed, the information may appear to be incorrect.

*** Bryan is severely pissed off.**

Only thing I can do now is wait another year, I better save up the money to get that domain because it's going to cost a small fortune.
