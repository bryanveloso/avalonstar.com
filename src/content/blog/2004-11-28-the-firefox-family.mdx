Well, here I sit waiting for the rest of the family to get up so I can go back home. I have to say that I'm glad, and then again, I'm not. There were a lot of things I wanted to do, but I'm glad it's over and I can go back to Jenni. But then again, there's work. Bah, oh well. ;) But read on! The good part is about to start!

I would like to proclaim the following: **My family is now officially a Firefox family.** Yes, it's true, with the help of my sister, her boyfriend and I, my parents (who are pretty much just now jumping into the internet) use Firefox as their daily browser. It shocked me after they looked at the computer screen and thought, "Where's the Firefox icon?" I had to apologize as I was upgrading their versions to 1.0, but you can't blame me right? As a person who has watched all these changes happen first hand, it was a really good feeling to know that they use it too.
