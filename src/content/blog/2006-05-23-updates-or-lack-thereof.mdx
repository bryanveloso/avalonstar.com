Just a quick entry while things on this end are settling down a bit. There are a bunch of things I have neglected to take care of (including a contact form) so I apologize for that in advance. I'll be working on all of that over the next few days. Things like headers for single posts, a grid layout, changing cookies to sessions - easy things like that. *puke*

But in the meantime, if you need to get in contact with me, you can always email me at bryan [at] avalonstar [dot] com. I've freed up some time to focus more on this place, so (don't expect, but anticipate) some things to come.

Anyway, feel free to say "hi" and leave me your love below. :)
