> [...] Yeah, you had interviews and powerpoint presentations, it made me feel like i could come and learn something all the time. That's what kept me coming back [...] now... i hate to say that you are another good looking blog in a sea of good looking blogs...

**News Flash**: Bryan, creator of Avalonstar, gets a much needed slap in the face from a good friend, more at 11:00.

Design after design has passed by, trying to create a design that was me, but not me. Post after post, written because I wanted to woo the crowd, not because I really wanted to write it. When you live under the veil of one name for so long, you can lose who you are and why you started. For almost two years, I've had designer's block the size of New York City, and I felt like abondoning this place many times - manily because I just couldn't do it anymore.

What was Avalonstar? What was I missing? What did I lose? Questions I kept asking myself, and questions I had asked friends as well, and it was funny how it all came back to simplistic design. But simplistic design wasn't the problem solver, that was the only thing I could do. I was missing the content, the meat of the whole site. Without it, it was just another blog.

So that's what's going to change, as you can see the design has changed, the dry humor is back, and so will the nice little features. Just give me time to think of some. I'm going to write because I want to, and have a good time doing it. In the meantime, enjoy dusting off the place while I get this work in progress fully functional.

**PS:** I know the site sucks ass in IE, I didn't design for it (and wasn't this [IE7 thing][1] supposed to fix the damn box model?), but if anybody would like to help me debug it after Avalonstar's done, please comment or email me.
