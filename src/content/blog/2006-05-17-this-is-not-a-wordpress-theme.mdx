Another anger post? Well, yes, another anger post. What triggered it you ask? This:

> I'm using your ChaoticSoul theme which is very nice, but Aries is definitely the best WP theme! *Gonna use it soon ok?* Congrats.

Sure, it's a few days old, but the feeling's still there. I guess you can't get away from it. People asking for Evolution as a WordPress theme? That'll never happen (maybe in another 3-5 years). The only reason I released ChaoticSoul as a theme is because I didn't want the Wayback Machine to start forgetting more of my old layouts. People **expecting** this layout to become a WordPress theme? Excuse me? I don't know about anybody else, but the sound of that just gets to me.

Anyway, rather than completely rant about it, I have a few more examples from my buddy [Kyle Neath][1]. We had a few conversations about this and he seemed to be running into a few of the same problems.

> Hey, I was looking at totalspore.com, and I loved the way you layed out the site. I make wordpress themes and release them to the public. I have made [theme name removed], maybe you heard of it. Anyways, I was wondering if it would be at all possible for me to get ahold of your source code. I don't really need the css, but I would love to see the files like index.php, sidebar.php and all of those.

Here's a bit of our conversation.

<dd>Well, I dunno it's weird I feel there's a distict difference between a deisgn and a template... comparing something like k2/hemingway/squible to something like my site, or totalspore</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>like... for example, I would say something like what Jeff Croft has: [http://www2.jeffcroft.com/][2] is a design based on a template like hemingway: [http://www.warpspire.com/hemingway_example/][3]</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>I've always seen a distinct difference between the two.. so when someone says "Can I download your Warpspire theme?" it bugs me</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>I guess I'm more focusing on the fact that they call Warpspire a theme.</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Somebody left me a comment that said, "I can't wait to use Aries," to that effect at least.</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>Exactly what I mean</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>like, I could easily see a theme *based* off Aries</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>but Aries is your design</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>not a theme</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>And therefore, it'll never happen.</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>But they expect it to.</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Yes, but I don't think people should expect anything to be available as a template. Where's the fucking originality in that?</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>I guess just because it's a set of templates (be it wordpress, MT, or HTML) doesn't mean it's a theme to download</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Yep.</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>themes are sets of templates that authors willingly release</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>That's why I think most wordpress "themes" fail... in that they're not really themes, they're designs</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>That's why Kubrick became so popular... it was a great starting point that allowed easy customization on top of it</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>be it header, or other</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Indeed.</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>People just need more originality in their life :)</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>I mean, it wasn't like this years ago.</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>People have been ... I dunno, warped into thinking that they can view anything based off a blogging platform as something that they can use on their own site.</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>There weren't this many people blogging years ago :)</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Rather than using it as inspiration to drive them, they want the work done for them.</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>Still, design is design.</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>I guess you have to realize that there's a surge of people blogging that can't design.</dd>
<dt>Kyle</dt>
<dd>Howevver, they should realize that designs are designs, and templates are templates</dd>
<dt>Bryan</dt>
<dd>True, but can't they have some dignity to realize the difference?</dd>

Harsh? Could be, but I try not to hide anything from you guys. But in this case, I feel that certain people need to be bitch slapped. The rest of this I'll leave up to all of you. I'm intrigued to hear your opinions.
