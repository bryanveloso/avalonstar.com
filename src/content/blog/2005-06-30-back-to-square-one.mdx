And what does this have to do with anything? Well, since the bitch slap in Savannah, many events have taken place and now I find myself back in California - the one place I didn't want to move to when I first started prospecting for jobs. No, I haven't gotten a job yet, but the future is looking bright thanks to some much appreciated [help][1]. So more than anything, being back in Banning with my parents is sort of like a necessary detour in this long trip.

> The foresight to know where you are going...

I wish somebody had told me that this would have happened, then I would have tried fighting it, but in hindsight, I do believe this was the best alternative course to Savannah. But who knows where I'll be now, my current aims are for the San Francisco Bay area first, and if that doesn't work, somewhere in North Carolina. Being here makes me feel like I am back at square one, no interviews scheduled, just back to making contacts and testing the networks. I'm hoping for a better outcome this time, but if you've been a job seeker before you know that there's only so much you can do.

I can only hope that it'll turn out well.
