A few days ago, I took the [Commonly Confused Words Test][1]. Surprised at my score (I'm a math person. Not so great at English), I wanted to see if anybody in my age group could get a score as good or better than this one:

> Beginner: 93%
> Intermediate: 100%
> Advanced: 81%
> Expert: 66%
>
> **Synopsis**: You have an extremely good understanding of beginner, intermediate, and advanced level commonly confused English words, getting at least 75% of each of these three levels' questions correct. This is an exceptional score. Remember, these are commonly confused English words, which means most people don't use them properly. You got an extremely respectable score.
