Definitely an odd feeling, working on this place again.

Version 26, _Redemption_, was up for a pretty long time—a little over 840 days to be exact. When I see it like that, all of a sudden I notice the dust that piled up around here. But not only that, it's been over 840 days since I've **worked** on Avalonstar.

Poor guy, I missed a couple of birthdays too.

When it comes to personal sites, especially _my_ personal sites, the ideas love to pop up suddenly. Very ninja like. The first neuron fired during the [Japanese-leg][1] of our honeymoon with one word, _"rise."_ Once I felt it—as much as one person can _feel_ a neuron firing, which is impossible and subsequently besides the point—I closed my eyes.

In my heyday, per se, I would've been able to think of my design, close my eyes and slowly see that design start to come together in a sort of 3D plane. Talk about rusty. I closed my eyes and all I saw was white with the word "RISE" at the top, my immediate thought being along the lines of "this shit's broken." The idea stayed with me for a few days, but I chose to wait to see if it was a fleeting thought or something my mind really wanted me to go with.

Sure enough, when I opened up Photoshop, I typed in the word "ARISE."

_rise_, _arise_, _revive_, _phoenix_... I'm obsessed.
