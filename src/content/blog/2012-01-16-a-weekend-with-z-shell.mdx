title: "A Weekend with Z Shell"

Almost a year ago, I was introduced to the Z Shell (or `zsh`), an alternative shell to `bash`, through [Kenneth Reitz][1]. Unfortunately, at the time it felt way too foreign. The uphill battle to configure the damn thing outweighed the pros that `zsh` was meant to provide. Also, I was too entrenched with the default command line shell that had been spoon-fed to me ever since I installed Ubuntu for the first time.

So I left it at that.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year and I ran into this article, "[My Command Line Prompt][2]," by [Geoffrey Grosenbach][3] of [topfunky][4] and [PeepCode][5] fame. I gained interest almost instantly. Why? The _visuals_ of course. It was a great mini-tutorial on what `zsh` could do. So over the weekend, I grabbed [oh-my-zsh][6], a wonderful starter kit from [Robby Russell][7] and went to work on the train to and from my parent's place.

Here's what I came up with in pretty picture form:

(The font I use is [Inconsolata][10].)

This is an amalgamation of ideas from Kenneth's `oh-my-zsh` theme and the aforementioned blog post by Geoffrey. It moves everything but the current directory to the right side of the prompt, also including the current `virtualenv` or `rbenv` when applicable. It has an easter egg as well, mainly for my own giggling satisfaction when a command boards a ship to fail.

If you're interested in seeing the code behind this, [you can take a look at my new `dotfiles` repository][9]. (There are a few goodies in there which are beyond the scope of this post.)
