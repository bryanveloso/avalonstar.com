A year ago today, I drove home with my first "real" car, my Mazda RX-8. (Like, one I pay for myself.) It's been one of the coolest (and most expensive) years, obviously, when it comes to automobile related stuff. I've washed it countless times, "wasted" a whole bunch of money on parts (and have stopped for the time being), and killed a few too many ricers. Nah, you can't kill too many of them. ;)

Time for the stats!

*   **Odometer Reading:** 16,000 (I predicted 20,857 when I hit 10,000 miles.)
*   **Average Miles Per Day:** 43
*   **Average Miles Per Month:** 1,333
*   **"Major" Modifications:** 5 (Cold Air Intake, Front & Rear Strut Bar, Front & Rear Sway Bars)
*   **Useless Purchases:** 4 (B-Pillar Appliques, Seat Covers, Tire Valve Caps, Sun Visor)
*   **Car Wash Visits:** **at least** 75 (one visit cost me over $200 - for a wax)
*   **Times Waxed:** **about 5** (including the one I just mentioned)
*   **Number of Dealer Visits:** **around** 25 (including the "recall")
*   **Number of Ricer Kills:** *WAY too many to count.*
*   **Number of Potatoes I Wish I Had:** I'd need more than are grown in the state of Idaho.
*   **Times I Hit Redline:** I also lost count of this.
*   **Average Amount Spent on Gas:** $45.00
*   **My Least Favorite Place to Drive:** San Franscisco (god damn hills.)
*   **Average Miles per Tank (16 gallon tank):** 290 miles (up from 216... o_O;)

Although I have taken a break from buying things for the car - and although I don't drive it as much as I used to - it's still a purchase I don't regret making. There are times I think to myself that it was too much, that I could have gotten something a little more affordable. Ultimately, that course of action would have been one that I'd regret.

Well, four years of payments to go, and a hell of a lot more modifications to do. ^_^;
