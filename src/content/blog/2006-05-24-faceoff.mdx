[In the words of the great Mike Davidson][1] — it is with both sadness and anticipation that I announce my departure from Facebook after 10 months of employment. Honestly, coming out of college and grabbing a job at one of the hottest properties on the web was a blessing I never saw coming. The 283 days I spent there were some of the most challenging and fast-paced of my life. I can't thank them enough for what they've given me — the opportunity to work with the smartest people that any organization would die to have, my newfound knowledge and interest in programming and the experience of how a start-up *really* works. In my time there, I've helped turn out the website's redesign and products such as Pulse, the new look for My Privacy, and the company's stationary and business cards. The company's grown in strides too long to be measured and I was proud to be a part of that.

Now, it's time to look ahead.

<del>I sit here, at home, on a new quest. It's a dark path, and I'm walking in blind.</del> <ins>Ok, scratch that, it sounded lame.</ins> Anyway, if you can remember, I don't have a design degree. I have a degree in [entrepreneurship][2]. Now's the time to flex that "trophy on my wall." There are projects up my sleeve, ideas in my head, and my ambition roaring to go. It's time to *revive* the passion in this industry. However, whether this will work or not is completely dependent on *my* passion. Avalonstar will finally be getting some needed tender loving care, and I hope to spend a lot more time giving it the treatment that will bring it to what I really envisioned for The Aries Project. The podcast? Well, let's just say I have a co-host now. *evil laugh*

All I have to say is that this is going to be one hell of a ride. You ready to come with me?
