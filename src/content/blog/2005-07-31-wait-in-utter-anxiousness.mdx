I'm sure I'll be getting those **important** few calls when I get up, but I can't stand waiting for Monday morning to come. I mean, tomorrow could be the first day of the rest of my life and here I am wanting the night to pass by as quickly as possible. I do believe I have picked a company that I would like to go forward with if the other doesn't totally overwhelm me with their offer. Want to know how? Here are *some* of the guidelines I used.

## Bryan's Tips to Picking Companies

1.  First and foremost, look at the company from the standpoint of an employee. Rather than focusing on the past successes (revenue, profit opportunity) of the company, focus on whether you'll be coming home wanting to break something after work.
2.  Inspect the different job functions. Will you be doing 100% of the primary function? Or will there be some extra baggage for you to carry? Can you handle the extra baggage? Or would you rather not deal with it?
3.  If you're doing anything creative, what's the chance that you'll work will be seen by eyes outside the company?
4.  If you'll be working with computers, make sure they have the type you'll enjoy working with (ie., OSX vs. XP vs. 'Nix)
5.  Go out of your way to meet the people you'll be working with and analyze their personalities respective to yours. Then ask yourself if those are people you'd want to interact with 8 hours a day.
6.  How fun is the environment overall? If it's an office job, is it open? Will you get to interact with your co-workers or are you confined to the area around your desk?
7.  What does the place do to keep you entertained? What do they provide in respect to extracurricular activities (if any)? Gaming tournaments, exercise machines and billiards tables are all examples of this.

Remember not to take anything else completely out of the picture, I just believe most people believe that just because a company is successful, they'll love the job. In my case, with The UPS Store, that attitude bit me in the ass.
