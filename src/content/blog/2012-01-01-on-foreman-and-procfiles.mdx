title: "On Foreman and Procfiles"

Over the last few years I've amateurishly covered the entire stack from design to server administration, and on that tirade I've managed to break many rules.

Premature optimization? _Check._
Refactoring without reason? _Check._
Overengineering? _Check._

I'm obsessive-compulsive about a few things. For example, I always fold chip bags into little squares before throwing them away. But that has nothing to do with anything. [I'm a very detail-oriented person][1], but to a fault. If I find something interesting about a particular process, for instance, I will spend exorbitant amounts of time learning its ins and outs. Wasteful? That's a fair assumption.

But I'll spare you the rest of the details and talk about my find of the day, the [Foreman][2] gem and the **`Procfile`**.

> But don't you program in Python?

Shut your face, that mentality is [_so_ yesterday][3]. I will prefer the Python implementation of a program as opposed to that of its rivals _if and only if_ it is a more _elegant_ solution. [SASS][4] and [Compass][5] proved that to me. Anybody remember [CleverCSS][6]? Yeah, thought so. [Practicality beats purity][7].

Alright, class is in session. Let me flip this around and show you my `Procfile` first, then explain what happens inside of it:

~~~ shell
compass: compass watch static
db:      postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
redis:   redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
web:     python ranking/manage.py runserver
~~~

So what does it do? Instead of opening a tab in Terminal for each of those items _or_ starting them as a daemon, it allows me to concatenate the operation into one simple command:

~~~ shell
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
~~~

Why `.dev`? In my case, the sans-extension `Procfile` in my project is for Heroku with production-only commands. If you run `foreman` without the argument, it'll look for `Procfile` by default. After you run that command you'll be greeted by this lovely sight:

~~~ shell
14:14:37 compass.1  | started with pid 3115
14:14:37 db.1       | started with pid 3116
14:14:37 redis.1    | started with pid 3117
14:14:37 web.1      | started with pid 3118
~~~

Like what you see? Great! If you've gotten this far, you should've already installed the Foreman gem by now and created a Procfile. Now, there are a few gotchas when working with your services in Foreman, especially if you're using [Homebrew][8], [Redis][9] and [PostgreSQL][10]:

1. **Foreman doesn't like daemons.** If you throw a command into your `Procfile` that dameonizes the process, Foreman will start the process only to shut down entirely because it disappeared like it was supposed to.
2. To that point, **test the commands that Homebrew gives you** when you run `brew info <formula>` **and see if it daemonizes**. Here's a freebie: the PostgreSQL command that Homebrew gives you: `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start` WILL daemonize it. You're going to want the command posted above instead.
3. If your program logs to `STDOUT` it'll all be aggregated. But if you've ever run `redis-server` through Homebrew, it's _VERBOSE_. To regain your sanity, go into `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf` and change the `loglevel` to `notice` or `warning`.

On a slightly related note, I _love_ [Homebrew][8]. I just _hate_ the way it instructs you to start processes. It's _shit_, especially if you're coming from a Linux development environment where `upstart` lives to massage your feet and feed you grapes. Do yourself a favor and [grab this script][11], throw it in your Homebrew's `bin/` and profit using `brew services start <formula>`, even if you don't use Foreman in the end.

If you do a quick search on Foreman, you'll rightfully see a slew of Ruby-centric articles. However, the amazing thing about this gem is that all it does is _manage processes_, so you can throw _anything_ in there, no matter what language you happen to be programming in. Over the weekend I've been working on moving [a wiki of ours][12] to [PHPFog][13], for my local install I've thrown `php-fpm`, `nginx` and `mysql` in a `Procfile` and it all **Just Worksâ„¢**. No more _struggling_ to remember commands. No more _forgetting_ to shut processes off.

There are lots of great things that people have been doing with `Procfiles`, [automatically running tests after saving files in Django][14] or [exporting it to `upstart`][15] if you're on Linux are just two examples.

So for once my obsessiveness has rewarded me with a streamlined development workflow, and I hope it'll do the same for you!
