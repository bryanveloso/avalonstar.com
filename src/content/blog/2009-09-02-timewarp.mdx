When I launched _Distortion_, it was launched with a little over 80 posts. For some reason I didn't feel that a good 160 of them were relevant anymore. When I set off to create _Redemption_, I had changed my mind and I brought the posts back.

Even though I know of a few people that have taken the time to travel back in time to Avalonstar's 19th version and 1st blog post, I know that everybody can't be bothered to click all the way back. So, if you have three spare minutes, check out this screencast that'll do the time traveling for you[^1].

[^1]: Once again, since I'm not willing, able, or rich enough at the current moment to spend the $60 for Vimeo Pro, I can only post a low resolution video here. I encourage you to head to the [video's page][1] and watch the HD version of the video. :)
