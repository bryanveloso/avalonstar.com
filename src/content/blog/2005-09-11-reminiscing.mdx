I don't know what it is about me and [Benzinger][1] but it seems like we get into the weirdest conversations about the "good 'ol days." Then again, I like to reminisce about those days and see how far I've come. That whole "knowing your past before creating your future," kind of thing. So this was the first time this happened:

<dialog>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>do you remember anything resembling... xist, xotech, xpired, xposure, xposed, etc back in the day?</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>Um...</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>like.. a few years back, maybe 4 or 5.</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>well, my brother said he remembers you from back then</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>he said he linked to you and halovision :)</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>Halovision. ;_; I miss that site, we were like brothers back then.</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>Christopher Dang =/ yeah, miss em</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>He only doodles on his LiveJournal now.</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>really? guh</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>But I do remember a site with "x"</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>xhibit5. That was the site I believe.</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>yeah, my brother told me that you and him were the best of the best in the design world then</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>That was my last "high" I guess you could say.</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>I mean after Chris left, I lost a source of motivation and Avalonstar died soon after that.</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>=/ yeah, my brother found out about you again after I told him about Avalonstar.. and he was like, "HES BACK!?!" LIke that, somewhat</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>Hahaha.</dd>
<dt>Brian</dt>
<dd>famous</dd>
</dialog>

Needless to say, I still sounded the same back then. This is from [Avalonstar's][2] [last era][3]:

> **welcome to my autobiographical emissions**
> This first month and some has been a wild ride, and for me, I'm not used to it. I have to first thank everybody who's contacted me about the site, your comments and suggestions have been great, and the support shown for this place has been great as well. I also have to thank my personal inspirations, you know who you are. There is a lot more to come on avalonstar.net as I learn new technologies and better ways of streamlining the site. So I encourage you to keep coming back, and contribute to the other sections as well and get your name out.
> Welcome to avalonstar, and enjoy your stay here.
> If you can say "unreal", that is how the last few months have been for me. Let me tell you that much. The highs and lows of being known in this niche of the design community have been both a pressure and a reward.
> Now if you can add the word "chaotic" to that, then have a brief understanding of what my life is like right now. With school, jobs, and a social life that is on the rocks; "chaos" cannot begin to explain anything.
> Life can take you through so much shit. Life can eat you up, semi-digest you, and then spit you out so you can experience more in a depleted state. At other times it's the exact opposite. I have found my happiness in friends otherwise would have never met. Life is slowly getting better, it's a lot different than it used to be, but at least I can pull a smile once a day.
> But enough of that, I'm a man of the people remember? And so I present chaoticsoul, the long awaited version twelve of Avalonstar. This version is as you can see a darker one; it will still have a lot of the content that you saw in the last installment, but with many extras too, look around and immerse yourself in the chaos.

Anyway, going way back, before Avalonstar, I had an AT&T WorldNet account dedicated to Final Fantasy. That was back in 1997 when I first started designing. It was called "The Final Fantasy Files," and I remember having 2 versions of it, and yes, it was FrontPage made. But don't shoot me! I've improved, haven't I? I wonder what would have happened if I still had that. Unfortunately, I don't think I ever kept a record of anything before Avalonstar began. Stupid me.
