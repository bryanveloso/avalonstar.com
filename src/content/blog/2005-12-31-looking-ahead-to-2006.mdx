First of all, I have to apologize that December has been quite a rough month for both me and Avalonstar, and the effects have shown. I never meant the year to come to such a "blah" end, but I'm sure there were a lot of us that suffered the same fate. On a brighter note, 2005 has been one of the best years of my online career since 2002. It's had the same feeling as back then, but with writing instead of digital art. Both years were years when I met people that I could find myself friends with for a long time. I've met some great people, and have kept some great friendships alive.

But this year had a different feel to it, mostly because I took a lot of you through my transition into the real world. I personally found myself meeting people I only read about, struggling to find a job, only to find myself with one of the companies out to change the lives of many. You've seen me grow from a lone blogger with a funky design to a member of one of the fastest growing networks in our industry today. We've been through discussions and comments, fights and apologies. You've all seen my ups and downs, my triumphs and my apathetic moments. Yet you're all still here. I can't be more thankful for that.

### 2006

So today is the final day of 2005, and for the first time, I won't be spending it with my parents. It'll just be Jenni and I watching the ball drop, three hours after it actually does in New York City. But that marks only one of the many changes that'll be in store over the next year. For me, I'll be going into full swing in my new role as Creative Director at Facebook. Jenni will be heading back to school to supercharge her path to being a mangaka (graphic novelist). What can another twelve months possibly bring? As for Avalonstar, the Aries project will usher in a broader and complete repositioning of the site, as I get ready to expand my horizons into places such as the drag racing and autocross world, and dip myself into a few of the other offerings the web has to offer. I hope to make a true comeback to my roots and fuse it with what I have now, I've missed being a digital artist, so I hope to flaunt whatever skills I have left in the next version. For projects outside Avalonstar, I have a few up my sleeve. Oh, and don't forget the 2005 PSD archive that will be making it's way to a download manager near you.

The greatest part about all this is that I have no idea where my road will take me. My life has truly begun, and all I can say is that I am extremely excited about what is to come. Events like SXSW, the visit to Infineon Raceway and trips to Minnesota and a return to the east coast - will keep me busy over the coming months.

All I know is that everything can only get better, and I am curious to know about what you have in store for the new year. As for the here and now, I would like to wish you a very prosperous New Year and that all the wishes and resolutions you have may come to fruition.
