Strolling in almost 12 hours late, here comes Avalonstar limping like a dog just hit by a car. Needless to say, I tried to catch this fall's [CSS Reboot][1]. Fortunately, I did get it done within the same day as the reboot. If you've been traveling around since about 10:00AM PST, then you've seen a pretty grim look at my development process. Rather than waiting and totally missing the date, I decided to launch with only 50% of the site, what you see now is about 75% of what I had wanted for this release. There are still a bunch of images missing, and the functionality is not all there either.

What functionality you ask? Well, let me tell you what I've been meaning to add.

Ever since I started using my 24 categories, I've had trouble fitting different posts into certain ones. Although I found the hype around folksonomy to be a bunch of lunacy, I found that its use can help my organizational sanity. So over then next few days, I'm going to be retagging all of my posts and eliminating categories altogether. Thankfully, this will allow me to call up compilations of posts with a certain tag, and hopefully it'll make it easier for you to find what you need here. In addition to that, I've added a little post box at the bottom that will show a random post on refresh, just so you don't forget my older babbles.

I'm sure you've seen how empty the Swag Shop is. That will change very soon as I am working with [Brian from Solution Watch][2] to create a pre-order form so you can start reserving your shirts. With regard to shirts, I'll be holding preorders for a few weeks to get a good look of what my first order to the supplier should be, and then shirts should be making their way out a week or so after that.

That's not all though, hopefully I can pull a few more features out of my sleeve before week's end. Maybe this experience will teach me not to procrastinate anymore. But remember, if you have any suggestions or bugs, be sure to let me know!
