In one of the few IRC (yes IRC) rooms I still frequent, high school came up. It reminded me of some messages I got recently from my old [Bridewater-Raritan][1] classmates on Facebook.

So, in response:

> My HS friends are starting to find my name, on the bottom of blogs that use ChaoticSoul.
> \>_>
> And they're like, "hey you! you're on some cafe website."
> And I think, "I wish I could describe to you what a theme is in terms that you'd get."

Yes. Not to mention, my claim to fame is having the WordPress theme that graces the most porn blogs. Don't believe me? You really don't want to see my Mint stats then--I've stopped clicking my referrals.
