I'm motivated in odd ways, maybe it's just my personality.

[![](/journal/2014/the-graphs-are-always-greener/contributions.png)][5]

This is my view of my own GitHub contributions graph. Ever since [Justin Palmer debuted this graph][1], it's haunted me. This is a good thing, because I look at it now and I'm proud of it.

Every day for the last year, I've managed to commit at least once to one of my projects. If it looks a bit anemic towards the beginning of the year, GitHub only counts contributions to repositories you *currently* have access to. Once I left GitHub, my contributions went with it. It irks me since I'm still a part of that history, but understandable and poetic in a microcosmic fashion.

The dark green in the latter half? [Hello! Base][2].

But I digress.

I'm a victim of data shame. Or rather, I have a phobia of breaking streaks. It's not that I don't break streaks, but I care about them enough that I'll go out of my way to keep them going. The fear of having a blank box in my contributions graph and having that "Current Streak" counter reset to zero was enough motivation for me to commit something first thing in the morning while [waking up to the beauty that is Scotland][3], for example. Don't worry, Jen's gotten used to it. ;)

Since I began to notice this trend of shaming myself with data, I try to take advantage of it by purposely feeling shame and acting on it. Call it a unique form of mental sadism. Whether it's commits, my weight, or [my kill/death ratio in Dota 2][4], it's seemed to work thus far.

Anyway, I guess it's time to shame myself into getting lunch.
