So this is a new one for me, as the last time I wrote about anything having to do with an automobile was back in December of 2004, when I was still in [my whole Mustang bit][1]. Fast forward to a year and a month later and I'm in a completely different situation. Throw in some research and some beatings over the head, and you have an asian buying an asian made vehicle. If you were to talk to me a few months ago, then you would have known the pain I was going through trying to decide on the car I would settle on.

But I'm sure I don't have to go through all of that in detail. To make a long story short:

*   I was looking between the $25,000 and $35,000 range, but I didn't want a standard car with no options.
*   I didn't want a BMW or a Mercedes Benz, or anything in that range.
*   Incidentially, I didn't want something that would make me look - rich.
*   After the Mustang, domestic cars were out of the question.
*   The Infinity G35 and Nissan 350Z only had 2 seats and needed a hell of a lot of options to be worth it.
*   The Lancer Evolution and the Subaru WRX looked way too plain. I wanted something that had the stereotypical look of a sports car.
*   The Scion TC was cheap, but didn't fit my "strict" style guidelines.
*   A hell of a lot more points that don't make much sense.

In the end, if you've been paying attention, you know what I've chosen. So without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to my 2005 Titanium Gray Mazda RX-8. The beauty is powered by 238 bhp and does naught to 60 in 5.2 seconds, but with my driving, that's more like 6 or 7 seconds. From the styling, to the engine, to the owners community - it's one of the most unique cars you can buy without spending a fortune for a supercar. I'm sure that many people will disagree, but it is all a matter of personal taste. Did I mention that it redlines at 9,500 RPMs? My personal taste happen to hovers around the phrase, "beauty without rice." No, I'm not talking about food, but if you've seen the bombshell pieces of shit - otherwise known as The Fast and the Furious - [then you'll know what I'm talking about][2]. But let's get off that sour note and onto something more positive.

Ahhh, that's better. So the rotary bit, why start talking about this all of a sudden? As you know, Avalonstar is an extension of myself, and if you read my post [explaining the purpose of the Aries Project][9], then you'll know that there are a lot of parts of me that people don't realize exist. My love for the automobile is one of those parts. During my many trips around our blogosphere, I never really found a non-professional auto blog or a site that just talks about the joys and trials of being a car owner. For me, it'd be a great experience to share, since this is truly my first all-out ownership experience. In that I mean - I pay for this car, I pay for the insurance and everything that goes into it. Like the old saying goes, "when it's your money, you care about it a whole lot more." This is very true in this case, the fact that I happen to be spending my money on something I've always wanted is the bonus. You know the feeling you get after a rush? Yeah, it's like that. No, this isn't a Sierra Mist advertisement.

On top of writing to share my experiences as a fellow owner, I do have a few goals by the end of my time with the Mazda. Two of those being, the journey to [Infineon Raceway][10] in [Sonoma][11] for my first try at the drag strip, and the journey to become an [amateur autocrosser][12]. Both are things I have always wanted to do and finally have the means (sort of) to do. Facebook and the web can't be my only time-munchers, and this is one (albeit expensive) hobby that I can carry out to the fullest. Personally, I want to make someting I can be proud of **other** than a website. At the very least, I want to document what I've done, what I've spent, and what I've been through.

So you can be sure this won't be the last post about the car, but I hope that it's something that people can find interest in, whether a veteran or new arrival to the site.
