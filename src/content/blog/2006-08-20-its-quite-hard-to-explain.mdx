So my Dad and I were talking at WalMart the other night:

<dialog>
<dt>Dad</dt>
<dd>So how do you like your new job?</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>It's great Dad, it's really fun.</dd>
<dt>Dad</dt>
<dd>So what does your company do again?</dd>
<dd>_* Insert semi-blank look._</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>You know that thing that Steffi uses called LiveJournal?</dd>
<dt>Dad</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>
<dt>Me</dt><dd>Well, the company makes a competitive product, which is WordPress.</dd>
<dd>_* Insert nervous smile._</dd>
<dt>Dad</dt>
<dd>Oh okay.</dd>
</dialog>

Ever experience this? Well, I'm sure in one way or another, a family member (whom isn't very fluent in our industry) has asked you the question of _what you do_. In my case, my dad's usually the one that asks me about the details of my job. We had the same sort of awkward conversation when I was asked what Facebook did, and later on that night when he asked me about what I would talk about at conferences. It really puts you in your place when you **know** what you do, but can't explain it in any other way to those who aren't in the _know_. Like my dad for instance.

_So you know that thing called blogging? No? Ok. Um..._

I don't believe there is much of a point to this. My head's burning and I think I've cooked myself in the summer sun, but that's besides the point.

But if I think about it, it was more of contemplation as to how many other people frequently run into this. Again, it shows you that we're in a niche. I mean, shouldn't we have an easier time talking about what we do for a living? Come to think of it, a paleontological microbiologist <small>(does that even exist?)</small> would have an easier time explaining what they do than we would. Does "I write stuff in a journal that's available to the world" suffice as a good enough explanation? What do you think? How do you describe what you do for a living to those who are unfamiliar with our world? Maybe those who are more experienced in storytelling can give us novices a bit of assistance.
