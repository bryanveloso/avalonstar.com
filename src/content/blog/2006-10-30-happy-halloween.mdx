Even though this post is being written before the big day on my end of the world, I did want to take the chance and wish all of you a very happy Halloween, whether you're scaring your neighbors or filling up with candy.

In the quirky spirit of this holiday, I wanted to share with you something that strikes at the very heart of my (and Jenni's) music tastes. In probably the only YouTube post you'll ever seen on this site (hopefully) - and in pure "Bryan loves J-pop fashion" - the following music video is by an artist known as [Kawase Tomoko][1] or better known to most as Tommy Feburary<sup>6</sup> & Tommy Heavenly<sup>6</sup> (yes, that's two personas). It's a single she released especially for Halloween, called "Lollipop Candy Bad Girl".

Hope you enjoy it - it's definitely worth all 10 minutes, 31 seconds. ;)
