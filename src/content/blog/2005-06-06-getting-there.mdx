Avalonstar's next miniseries? **Destination: Savannah.**

For those of you who don't know yet, Jen and I will be moving to Savannah, GA. I will be starting my career (in who knows what), while she starts her schooling in sequential art. This next week will be dedicated to finding the job that will start me off on that "next step".

So hello from Georgia, I'm in Atlanta right now at one of these "private office" facilities. I could have waited to get to Savannah to write this, but chances are I would have forgotten what to write. That seems to be the state of my memory these days. Atlanta International, especially the Delta terminal, is pretty well laid out. It's the first time I had taken Delta in at least 5 years - Northwest, Southwest and JetBlue had taken its place. I couldn't even count how many flat screen monitors there were as I was passing by trying to find my way. Sleek things are the way to get my attention, and just by having amenities such as the monitors, private office facilities and complimentary laptop recharging stations are things I wished all the other airports I traveled to had. Granted after the move to Savannah, I'll most likely find myself going to either Detroit or to Atlanta for my connections.

**Edit**: Remind me to shoot the person who made the PA system. All I have to say is loud static and chipmunk voices.

Since this machine doesn't have Photoshop, I can't illustrate anything I've been thinking about. But being back on an airline where seats are assigned, it irked me that they still board from the front of the plane backward; shouldn't it be the other way around? To me, it'd seem more efficient that way. Hopefully the illustration will drive my point home. The other thing I have to remember to do is to an illustration of what the Delta information monitors look like and what I think they should look like (just as something to do). And on top of that, the topic of the next **Firewire** will be [Steve's][1] announcement today regarding Apple and Intel.

So my connection lasts for about another 45 minutes or so then I shall be in Savannah. Next report will be from there, and then things will get serious.

**Another edit**: If any "high profile" designers read this, does anybody think a kind of "The Contender" type minigame for web design is in order? If not, then throw it away as one of those dumb ideas I came up with in the shower
