Did you know I did print design? Maybe not, but since I haven't shown anything I've done since launching this blog, might as well right?

My newest endeavor encompassed Facebook. I had sat in on a few meetings with a firm we had hired to do our identity work. To make a long story short, Mark didn't like their work and I volunteered to take their place. So after a lot of typing, a few versions and an education in four-color process, these cards were produced. As you can see, it resembles the look of a member's profile, and as a bonus, I even included a place where the employees could pick a tagline for themselves. If you're wondering about specifics, they're printed on 130-pound matte stock. There are three colors involved, Pantone 661, Pantone 656, and black.

Hopefully from here, we can get the rest of our stationary out.
