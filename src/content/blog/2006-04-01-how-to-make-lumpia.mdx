Lumpia is a traditional Filipino appetizer, not unlike eggrolls. Graciously borrowed from Chef Andy Pforzheimer[^1].

> **For the Filling:**
> *   3 cups cabbage, shredded
> *   2 cups green beans, julienne strips
> *   2 cups carrot, julienne strips
> *   3 cups rutabagas, julienne strips
> *   1 cup sweet yam, julienne strips
> *   1/2 cup garbanzos (chick peas)
> *   1/4 cup chinese parsley
> *   1 cups shrimps, shelled and deveined
> *   1 cup chicken breast, cut in small strips
> *   4 pieces bean curd (firm tofu), julienne strips
> *   2 cloves garlic
> *   1 small cooking onion, sliced
> *   salt to taste
> *   fish sauce to taste
> *   1/4 cup cooking oil
>
> Saute garlic in oil until light brown. Add chicken and onion. Season with fish sauce. Remove from pan. Repeat the process with the shrimp, but stir-frying quickly and remove from pan immediately. Return the chicken-onion mixture to the pan, add in sequences, green bean, garbanzos, carrot, rutabagas, yam, cabbage, bean curd. Add a little stock and allow to simmer until the desired tenderness. Season with salt, fish sauce to your taste. Add the Chinese parsley last, just before removing from the pan.

[^1]: Note that these aren't the ones I eat. I just like the ones with ground pork, beef and oyster sauce. Fuck the fillings, the meat's where it's at. And I can't finish this entry without mentioning that my mom's lumpia are the absolute best. Bar none.
