So if you're living under a rock, iTunes 9 came out today. To practice writing short posts, I only have two things to say:

## To the iTunes UI Team

For the love of all that is holy, _STOP DEVIATING FROM MAC OS X._ Seriously guys, do you get off at making iTunes look different? What is this, plastic? Now you'll have all the rumor mills saying that this'll be what 10.7 will look like. I'm calling it, right now, some upstart on Wall Street is going to analyze and predict that 10.7 will look like iTunes 9.

## To the Mac OS X UI Team

For the love of all that is holy, _WILL YOU IMPLEMENT THE DAMN ITUNES SCROLLBARS AND LET AQUA DIE THE DEATH IT SHOULD HAVE DIED MILLIONS OF INTERNET YEARS AGO?_ Seriously. I'm sure the iTunes UI team is RIGHT NEXT DOOR. You could, you know, go in ninja attire one night and steal the NIBs from them. It's THAT easy, and you'd be able to dress like **NINJAS**. WIN WIN AMIRITE?

(But in all seriousness, great job guys. The pros definitely outweigh the fashion faux pas.)
