Shut up. I know you were expecting this.

Day 4 in Savannah, and I've changed the name of the category from **Destination: Savannah** to **Destination: Where?** because frankly, we don't know where to go from here. So as you may have guessed, Enterprise didn't want me, and that's their loss. On top of that, Jen doesn't seem ready for SCAD just yet. We'll definitely find our way back to this area, and hoepfully by that time I'll have better chance. So after some quick changes, I'm cutting my 7-day trip down to 4-days as I find myself leaving in a few hours.

Going forward, Jen and I made some new choices as to where she's going to school in the meantime. That and I needed to find a place that hosted a more diverse job market than Savannah. We're staying strapped to the Atlantic, that's much for sure, but ask to specific places here are our choices:

1.  North Carolina
    - Charlotte
2.  Florida
    - Miami
    - Tallahassee
    - Jacksonville
    - Tampa
    - Orlando
3.  Washington, DC
4.  Georgia
    - Atlanta
