I promised, didn't I?

So, while trying to take my mind off the reboot and thanks to some pestering from a few online buddies, I present to you, "Avalonstar - The 2004 Archive." I've finally gone through and picked not only PSDs, but AIs and even one coded site. Each of these pieces were either abandoned versions of Avalonstar, forum skins and site designs that never made it to the client (or that the client never paid for). That'll explain why some of these are so empty, but those are the ones I encourage you to take and play with. As you can see with some of the documents, including the TGA (tokyogameaction.com) files, my style has gotten a lot simpler. Maybe it's laziness. You'll also find my last three pieces of digital art, so you can see what I used to do in that arena as well.

The 2004 archive is a good 20MB of raw data about the way I work. Not many people would go ahead and do this, but I thought that I'd put some of these old files to work rather than have them sit around waiting for my next drive to crash. Download this knowing the above facts. I really don't want to be extending my generosity only to find people killing something I gave for free. Makes sense right? Thought so.
