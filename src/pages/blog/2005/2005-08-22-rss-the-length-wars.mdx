With things finally calming down here, I took the time to look at my RSS feed in Safari (since I have not migrated my [NetNewsWire][1] feeds as of yet). I remember asking [James][2] this a while ago, but I wanted to pose the question to generate a detailed look at the situation.

Half the sites (inlcuidng Avalonstar) have short RSS feed entries, which I consider to be 250 words or less. The other half are longer RSS feeds, displaying the entries with pictures and all (an example could be [Gizmodo][3] or [Words for My Enjoyment][4]).

So to make this long story short, what is your preference in regards to RSS feeds and why? When should you use an long RSS feed and when should you use a short one? Time to debate.
