\#47? Food? Hungry? Yes? Mmmmm...

Short and sweet stays this number as the food at lovely Johnson & Wales University is at the unforgettable caliber of quality. The food tastes as good as the quality of the last sentence's grammar. But when you go to college, how can you not complain about the food, especially if it is made by the chefs that seem to fail all their labs. It's a staffing problem alright, and I wish they'd fix it - at least for the well being of the students coming in the future. Nobody should have to live through a sitting of that crap.

The point? One usually doesn't put bad moments on a countdown like this. But the food was so bad, I'll never forget it. That and I now value food a hell of a lot more than I used to.
