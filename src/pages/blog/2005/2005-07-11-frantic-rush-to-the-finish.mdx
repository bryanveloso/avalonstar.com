Well! Slap me silly and call me AJAX, look at what the 'ol 'roll dragged in. It's a biggie!

You never know how many hits a site gets until you start getting attacked by it. But this is one of those good attacks, pretty refreshing if you ask me. I'm sure about 99% of you are coming from the Vault right now, and I thank you for coming. I'm also sure that you're wondering either what the hell to do or why the hell I was put up on the Vault in the first place. In either case, it's a pleasure to have you as a visitor.

Now for a few notes I guess. The first being that **the site is still a work-in-progress**. I bet you that you'll come here tomorrow (hopefully) and see something different, manily because I still have some quirks to work out and then the ever popular "getting the piece of crap website to work in the piece of crap browser." If by any chance you can help with that, please let me know. The second note ties in with the first in that not all the content is here, I have a lot of other little tidbits to publish and I'm still waiting for **somebody** to start off my "Famous Last Words" series. Again, you can contact me for that.

Finally, here's what's in store for the coming days:

*   The (mt) Mailbox Scandal
*   Un-confusing PowerPoint
*   The "Inside the Life" Project
*   This website... 100% done. \*laugh\*
*   This website working in IE. \*puke\*
