I guess you could say that today ends the first week of my job with Facebook. So let's wrap up this time sheet, shall we?

*   August 15: **10.0 hours** <small>(10:00AM - 8:00PM)</small>
*   August 16: **13.5 hours** <small>(10:30AM - 1:00AM)</small>
*   August 17: **5.0 hours** <small>(11:00PM - 4:00PM)</small>
*   August 18: **17.0 hours** <small>(12:00PM - 5:00AM)</small>
*   August 19: **12.0 hours** <small>(3:00PM - 3:00AM)</small>
*   August 20: **13.0 hours** <small>(1:00PM - 2:00AM)</small>
*   August 21: **11.0 hours** <small>(3:00PM - 2:00AM)</small>

So total that all up and you'll get 81.5 hours or about 11 hours a day. Note that Wednesday was the day that [I scouted an apartment in San Jose][1] and also the day I met up with the [9rules][2] executives. So this is by far the longest week I have ever worked for any job, clobbering the 52 hours I had worked for [The UPS Store][3] (the main difference being 7 days straight compared to 5 days straight). By no means am I complining as I know that there are many people out there that consistantly work 12+ hours a day. This is mainly from a personal perspective. Needless to say, my biological clock is busted and my sleep patters need some work.

So what has grown through all of this? If you've kept up, you'll already know that I have been put to work coding and applying the master style to different pages of the site while learning SSH, PHP and Subversion. Well, you didn't hear it from me, but the work is winding down as we're approaching our release date of tonight (11:59PM). Do not expect to see my design style, but if you're a member and peruse the code, you'll notice my coding style (by the way, if you're not a member, I highly encourage you to join and add me as a friend).

I can effectively say that I want to shoot the developers of Internet Explorer for having the audacity to create such a rebellious browser. It's not cool guys, really. I know you're big Microsoft and all, but because your browser sucks I wasted at least 12 hours of my life debugging specific IE bugs. But I could also push some blame on the developers of the site for not thinking of testing in IE. Thankfully, that's all past us and I have a couple of bugs left to squash.

I'm going to add that I've run into some quarrels with the *cascading* portion of CSS, and if `text-decoration` were a person, I would shoot it dead.

So while this week ends my first, it also marks the last day I'll be working on Facebook's facelift before it launches. In any case, I certainly think it looks better than the first version and I am glad to have been a part of the team. To those itching to see what I can do with a blank canvas, don't worry, I've already been assigned to design a few of their upcoming services from scratch. Now **that's** something I'm looking forward to.
