It's 7AM in the morning, and it's the first time I'm up this early to see a movie at a theater no less. The movie? [Star Wars III: *Revenge of the Sith*][1]. The saga is ending. But wait, it's only the 15th you say? Well, of all movies, I'm glad that this was the one I got to see early (thanks to my [vegetable friend][2]).

**Update:** First of all, go see the movie as soon as it is released. Secondly, be prepared for the best movie of the new trilogy. *Revenge of the Sith* is the tragedy that everybody wanted, and the missing link in finally connecting the 70's trilogy and the millennium trilogy. So sure, Lucas got help with the dialogue, what's wrong with the help if it made the movie so much better? Once again, the graphical effects are top notch and the line between CG and real life became even more blurred. I have been a casual Star Wars fan for some time, so after I saw *The Phantom Menace* I looked up the potential story that would fill the gap, so I had a little knowledge of how the plot would come together. However, just the way everything was put together really cast shadows over episodes 1 and 2. That's all I'll say for now, since it's not public yet. But I **urge** you to go see it.
