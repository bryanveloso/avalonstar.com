Meh. Looks like I'm falling behind. Well, this one and the next one are pretty short; although the events are pretty "life changing" I guess you could say. #44 on memory lane relates to another formally dreaded aspect of food. Now, by a show of hands, who likes to eat their vegetables? Well, not many (vegetarians don't count). I never used to like anything that wasn't meat, or junk food. If it was green, unless it was with meat, I didn't eat it. And forget about all those "specialty" vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, those didn't find my mouth too often either. Before last year (and my try at the [South Beach Diet][1]) I used to only like lettuce and carrots, not together obviously.

That changed after I found myself not fitting into my size 32 jeans. Normally my waist is a size 30, but I liked the extra room. So with all the psychological changes that tried to come about and after reading the book, [The South Beach Diet][2], I wanted to try it out. You should have seen the look on my mom's face when I ordered a salad from a fast food restaurant.

Today, I am still trying to keep on the diet, which works when aggressively applied. I now eat tomatoes, as well as many other kinds of greenery one would find in a salad. However, pickles and cucumbers still aren't my thing. Can't win them all I guess.
