100 days are left before graduation. 100 days before a 16-year education ends. 100 days before the best four years of my life come to a close. Here I stand in the 9th week of the 2nd trimester, and I'm staring at the final 11 weeks of my college career.

People always work with the mentality that "the grass is always greener on the other side of the hill". But when you really sit down and think about it, would you have had it any other way? If all the bad things about college were pushed aside for just a minute, would it be so bad? Becuase if that were to happen, all that would be left are the memories. Don't we all love to reminisce?

So for the next 100 days (starting on the 12th) up until the May 21st, I will be counting down the 50 moments that were special to me over the past four years. These aren't only memories of [Johnson & Wales][1], but ones that also encompass the four years I've been in Providence - the people I've met, the places I've been and the things I've done. Not all good, but not all bad either. Some can even be a little humorous if it can be related to. Join me on this journey, I'm sure it'll be a fun one.
