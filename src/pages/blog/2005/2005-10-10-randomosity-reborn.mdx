Random thoughts... start... now.

*   Eh, I started to "reinvent" my own boxes.
*   <span style="color: purple">* Bryan opens Photoshop.</span>
*   This place needs a little polishing.
*   I hope I'll get that alternate style in time for the Reboot.
*   Got to get this click and cloth shop built.
*   Whoring myself out to get money for the cloth shop.
*   I have to stop taking projects.
*   My posts need more structure, maybe... a topic every 30 days?
*   I think I'll give in and start using del.icio.us, and maybe add it to this site.
*   Should I do a theme for Halloween?
*   Microsoft should take their new RSS logo and shove it up their ass.
*   I wonder if anybody likes Draftlets.
*   Inside the Life... arggggh.
*   Who the hell would supply capital to a start-up site that does tagging.
*   *Related:* Can anybody say bubble?
*   Need post how-to things, like worthwhile stuff.
*   \*cough\* **I'd like feature requests** \*cough\*
*   More sleep would be good.

Good night. :]
