Okay class, let's continue with this while forgetting that I still have 444 entries from the [9rules OPML][1] to read. Thank god for [NetNewsWire][2].

Okay now, come on, out of all the batons to slap me across the face, it had to be this one. But thanks to [Dave][3] for giving me a shot at this. Okay class, you're in for a rude awakening. I only read when I'm extremely bored.

## Books On My Shelf

About 20. If you include [Jen's][4] book collection, then that would put it about 180.

## Last Spent Money On

"[The Zen of CSS Design][5]" by Zen Masters, Dave Shea & Molly Holzschlag. The more I look through this book (all envy aside) the more I start to grasp another understanding of how those great designs were made, and it also inspires me to do my own. But man, if I had any trobule desiging, it would be for the [Garden.][6]
