... nor are a lot of other things.

For some reason, the site doesn't seem to be all that incomplete. Sure, you can't browse archives, post comments, see a home page or read about me--if anything, I did accomplish all three of the goals I had for this sprint[^1].

## Goal, the first.

I wanted to blog again. I don't know if you've ever heard of somebody not being able to blog because of an overwhelming design, but that's exactly what version 25, _Distortion_, was for me. Not only did I feel obligated to write longer posts, I **needed** to write longer posts since shorter ones looked like complete crap. Valid reason? It was for me. So I departed from the sheer graphical mammoth that was _Distortion_ with a design that was another challenge for me--one that was light, minimal and typographic (and chock full of HTML5 and CSS3).

## Goal, the second.

Since I wrote about the second goal on the [GitHub project page][2] for what I code named _the Phoneix Project_, I'll just go ahead and post that here:

> One day, I forget when, I had a crazy idea. I wanted to put a blog on Revyver. "Oh hell no," I said, "what about Avalonstar?" Well, Avalonstar is just sort of sitting there right now, but I really didn't want to pile Revyver news on Avalonstar and force people to go to Avalonstar when all they wanted to see was Revyver-related bits and vice versa.
>
> Then I thought, maybe a custom theme. Nah, it'd be too weird. People would be looking through archives on Avalonstar, only to see a Revyver story, click on it and then get transported to a post on the Avalonstar domain that looked like it should have been on Revyver. Confusing right? Well, even if it isn't to you, it was to me.

**Phoenix** is the [pony][3] power behind Avalonstar, Revyver and the next version of [Konokoi][4] (Jen and my joint blog). It'll hopefully allow me to a lot of nifty things with regards to sharing content between the sites. The engine is still very much a work in progress, but I'm as happy with this codebase as I am with [Hello! Ranking][5]'s.

## Goal, the third.

My third goal was one that I've had for a long time now, almost as old as _Distortion_. As I was converting selected posts to Markdown for _Distortion_, I wondered about context. When most people redesign, their old posts assume their new design--and they lose context. I wanted a way to not feel guilty about redesigning (read: I got at least 10 questions a year after I retired the egg rolls about when they were making a return).

So Redemption is not just one design, it's *one new design plus seven redesigns*, or "memories," of old versions. If you click the previous button a few times, you'll see version 25, and so on, all the way back to version 19, _Knighted_. It's what I consider the crown jewel of this version. As I go on to version 27, 28 and beyond, these designs will stay to forever give context to the articles that were posted during their tenure.

So there you have it. While I haven't built everything in that you would come to expect a blog engine would have, I was able to accomplish my personal goals by building the blog first. In the coming days I'll be fleshing out the rest of the site (since I still have Revyver to work on).

Special thanks go out to my partner in crime, [Greg Newman][6] and my good friend [Chris Harrison][7] for starting the idea of the [SiteSprint][1]. It was definitely what I needed to get off my ass and start re-imagining my family of sites[^2].

[^1]: I don't go into extreme depth on any of these points, as I need to give myself more reasons to blog. :) I'm sure you understand.
[^2]: I'm still on the fence about whether or not I should bother adding comments back. While I adore conversing, I'm starting to really get annoyed at the "Smashing Magazine" grade of comment that's starting to become prevalent. If you'd like to "comment" [throw me an @reply][8] on Twitter and/or use the hash tag #as244.
