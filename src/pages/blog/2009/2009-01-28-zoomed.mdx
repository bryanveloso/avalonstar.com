Now for something completely different.

I have an addiction to using âŒ˜ + 8.

For the non-Mac amongst you, command + 8 is used to zoom into the screen. It's an accessibility feature, but on those "off" days of mine, I enjoy working with it. Any normal person would think that it's a bit nuts, and I'd have to agree with them. But hell, it's fun. :)

So a few months ago, [I decided to record a session][1], I just never got around to blogging about it. So enjoy, if you're not prone to motion sickness.

For those that are interested, the music is "Theme of Battle" from Motoi Sakuraba's [Tales of Series Battle Arrange Tracks][2].
