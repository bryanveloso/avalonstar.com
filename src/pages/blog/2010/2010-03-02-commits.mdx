1609 commits after I started development on [Hello! Ranking][1], we're finally sitting at the point in every application's life when its owners let people start stepping through the doors for the first time. Tonight marks our private beta release--my legs are shaking, my nerves are high, but according to [Steve][2]... that's okay. :)

I've come to learn many things about myself "trying" to be a developer. One of those would be that I seem I talk to myself a lot in commit messages. The point of commit messages is usually to let _others_ know what code you're changing and why.

So, when you're pretty much on your own, who reads those messages _other than you_? Yeah, exactly.

That said, I'd like to commemorate today by posting just a sliver of the conversations I have with myself in Hello! Ranking's Git repository--well, at least the more memorable (read: failure ridden) ones.

Oh, and as expected when things go wrong, expletives happen. You've been forewarned.

* Mass debugging and fixing of stupid typos.
* Fixing a minor error on the artist_detail template. Making the two list templates look awesome.
* Flipping names for all the gaijin. :P
* Adding some dummy views so the URLs won't cry.
* Fixing another typo. Honestly have no idea how this happened.
* Hopefully this is the final time I have to fix this.
* THIS is the problem I hope I don't have to re-fix.
* I say blah to test data. D:
* Removed the slug field from the Story admin since it doesn't exist. D:
* Damn typos. D:
* DAMN TYPOS. D:
* DAMN IMPORTS. D:
* I could swear I did the feeds.py stuff. I'll look at that later.
* I FOUND FEEDS.PY! IT WAS ELOPING WITH /NEWS/! D:
* Forgot some things. D:
* Forgot a comma. Geez.
* Okay, seems like you can't have save_form() and save_model() coexisting if commit=False. Makes sense. I think.
* Removing a comma.
* Changing the range()... range.
* Adding the required space in "Hello! Ranking."
* I'm an idiot. I thought you had to chain order_by()s to get them to work. Hah.
* We do not code in 1337-5p34k.
* Forgot why I needed a README for a private project. :P
* Let's make sure to GZip stuff, k? :)
* LOTS of changes and fleshing out of admin-side things. Too many to count, so just look at the diff. :D
* FINALLY fixed this stupid error with urlpatterns. Turns out I forgot "patterns" before the tuple. -_-;
* This feels a little less... redundant.
* Forgot a comma. Damnit. D:
* Am I bored? All URL view calls are in quotes. Getting rid of all the unecessary imports. Watch me change this.
* Silly trailing comma seems to ruin everything when it comes to JSON.
* Stupidly subclassed a class that didn't exist.
* Forgot a damn comma.
* And.. why is this CleverCSS stuff still here?
* Overhauling the navigation. Not done yet. I know I've done this before. :/
* Making the managers more sane. D: What the hell was I doing?
* PyFlakes cherry breaking.
* De-stupified the groups application manager too. D:
* ALL of these changes are thanks to PyFlakes. All inconsistencies have been repaired. Hopefully you won't see me going, "OH FUCK I FORGOT A COMMA," much anymore. :D
* Removing esses.
* Adding an email obfuscation templatetag for the awesome power of obfuscating emails. >_>
* Massive DRY fail. D:
* A case of "I should take my own advice." fail.
* Choice? Who says we give users a choice? :P (Markup filters are now only bbCode and Markdown.)
* Trying to do the impossible, merging the concepts of django-registration (with backends) and django-socialregistration. Things are crazy and awry. Much work to be done here. D:
* Adding an admin file to accounts to get the app to shut up about it.
* Things won't work if you name the URLs wrong. D:
* Capitalizationizing.
* Silly kwargs.
* That's really outdated shit, man.
* Updated H!R logo (read: bigger) and navigation sprite.
* Doing some unholy wrapping with divs.
* How did this get there? o_O
* Made a whoopsie with the URL names.
* New "little heart with plus sign" file. Replaces old "little heart with plus sign" file.
* Funny, we don't even use feedfinder in the codebase.
* Yeahhh... let's make sure to crop these large images. D:
* Finally getting rid of the old stylesheet directory. Weights being lifted off of chests.
* Syntax errrorrrz. D:
* Renaming /comments/ to /replies/ for great justice.
* MOAR syntax errorrz.
* Moving /blogs/ to /topics/. If I don't want people to think the blogs are blogs, I shouldn't call them blogs. D:
* Anal-comma-issues.
* Apparently, registration wasn't in INSTALLED_APPS. o_O;
* Baleteing old images.
* Holy shit! Honest-to-god unit tests (for rankings)! And they pass too!
* Forgot a period. That's a first.
* Whoops. I only forgot the MAIN part of the new bulk-add/remove feature. :/
* Moar verbage.
* Renaming datetime.py to dateutils.py... since... it wasn't working.
* So THIS is why I had "context['context']." I WROTE it like that. D: Ugh.
* Gotta crop the minis.
* The private-beta... or rather... just beta, home page. Finally this changes! :D (After like, a year and a half.)
* Making the header not be pink.
* The things I do to make sure whitespace is handled correctly. >_>
* God damn I suck at typos.
* HARK! The tests failed and I found a bug! Rejoice! o_O;
* SUMMON THE GUNICORN! D:

I plan to talk about Hello! Ranking in a manner that's a little less pointless... that is, if I survive this whole "beta" thing.
