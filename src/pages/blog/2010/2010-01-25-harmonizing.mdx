If you're seeing this, then you're seeing Avalonstar on [Harmony][1], the awesome website management tool by my good friends [Steve and John][2].

After months of creating and then running my "multi-site CMS in Django," the tool that used to power this and [Revyver][3], the novelty wore off. Nothing hits you quite like finding out through your analytics that your site was down half a month[^1]. ;)

Don't know if I'll go into any more detail _just_ yet, but you never know. I need to recuperate a little from importing all 255 of my posts from Django. :) What I will say is when [Harmony][1] does debut, you will all love it.

[^1]: Yes, I know, totally my fault... and all it took was a restart to get it back anyway.
