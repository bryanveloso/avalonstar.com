Last year, [I presented the concept of J-pop to my colleagues of GitHub at my first summit][1]. It was _surprisingly_ well received. Since I missed a summit due to the wedding, I gave my second summit talk yesterday. When it came to this year's topic, as always, Jen was the catalyst that got me startedâ€”two weeks in _advance_.

I need to work on putting coherent sentences together, but at least the slides were pretty! ;) <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523ghsummit">#ghsummit</a></p>&mdash; Bryan Veloso (@bryanveloso) <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanveloso/status/159751779964301312" data-datetime="2012-01-18T21:39:27+00:00">January 18, 2012</a></blockquote>

Here's a quick preface.

The day I finished my first Django app, three or four years ago, my life changed. Up until then I was an _interface designer_ who had _a lot of ideas_ but never the _foundation_ to go forward. Also, I feared it. But after that first successful app, I wanted to know the **entire** stack. So over the next few years I tried everything, from [Cocoa][2] to [Puppet][3] and now [Redis][4] and [Rails][5]. I followed what was interesting and what seemed fun at the time, even if it was a _waste_ of time. So, I started to associate with the concept of a hybrid.

Oh yes, my presentation. I found a lot of parallels to two of the greatest series of platformers of all time, [Mega Man][6] and [Mega Man X][7] for the NES and SNES respectively. [I talked a bit about Mega Man X last month][8], but I completely ran with it this time. As to not derail the deck, I'm quite happy to present _"Super Hybrid Robots"_ below:
