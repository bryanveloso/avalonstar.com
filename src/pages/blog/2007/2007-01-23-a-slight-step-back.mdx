To say the least, it's been a rough road over the past few months and my work on Avalonstar's Aries Project II has fallen behind. For the time being, I've brought back the old Aries Project so you don't have to look at a project that may not be finished in the next few months.

There are two reasons (besides the obvious ones) that have held me back.

1.  A planned change to Django.
2.  The rethinking that goes with a change of this magnitude.

To say the least, it's been an eye opening experience for me. Migrating from platforms such as MovableType and WordPress, which decided a lot of the data structure for me to a platform where I decide every single little detail is completely overwhelming. So it's back to the drawing board for me, and hopefully after a few more projects have found themselves completed - Avalonstar will get the redesign and reconstruction that it deserves.

In a way, I feel like I've failed all of you - but I hope you all stay hopeful for what's to come.
