**2** pieces of digital art, **3** retired designs, **3** abandoned projects, **4** grids, **numerous** amounts of other crap in **24** Photoshop files comprising **78** megabytes of art and design goodness. **34.7** megabytes of stuff after compression.

So 2007 has come around and I seemingly passed into the new year forgetting something. For those of you who are new to Avalonstar, last year I distributed over **300 megabytes** of my old Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and HTML files that were sitting on my hard drive rotting. The two files comprised 2 years of my work which I decided would be better off helping other people understand the process and techniques of this wayward designer. The last two files were downloaded over 3,000 times respectively (don't ask how much bandwidth that was) and it's time to unveil 2006's version.

Now what you won't see in here are any live sites (like this one) and any sites that clients have paid for. What you will see are bits and pieces of work that are probably meaningless, but could be good starting points to future projects of yours. Don't expect to be compltely overwhelmed by the quality of some of these, apparently I didn't do as much personal or freelance work as I thought I did last year. o_O;

Remember that these files are provided mainly as a learning experience and I'd like it to stay that way.

So with that out of the way, I'll provide the links to download all three files. Enjoy![^1]
