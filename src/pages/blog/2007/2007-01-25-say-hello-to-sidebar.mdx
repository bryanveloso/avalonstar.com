I'm excited and honored to announce to all of you the start of something that I've personally been extremely anxious to do in recent memory. Ever since last year's SXSW, there were a lot of ideas being thrown around and a feeling of empowerment. Unfortunately, ideas born that way usually stay as ideas. I'm happy to say this is not the case.

So along with [Steve Smith][1], [Jonathan Snook][2] and [Dan Rubin][3], I present [Sidebar Creative][4].

Many of you know how excited I get when it comes to the beginnings of journeys and such. God knows how many I've invited you on since I started blogging here. Yet, this one is particularly special. It's the combination of four freelance businesses, each containing people who have their own special talents. We all share the same goals and the same ideals, which makes this an awesome match. As a team, we have a lot more to provide to clients than any of us could individually. We all share a respect for the industry and a mutual respect for each other. Actually, to be completely honest, I just love the fact that I'm getting the opportunity to work with these three because they're all great friends of mine.

In all seriousness, if you have a challenge, [throw it at us][4]. We can take it. ;)
