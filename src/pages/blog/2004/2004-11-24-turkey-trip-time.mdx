It's 3:30 in the morning and there's only one reason I'm pulling an all nighter... I have a flight to California at 7:55AM. Yes it's that time of the year again folks, I'm going to see my family for Thanksgiving. What makes me feel real bad about this whole thing is the fact that Jen can't go because of scheduling issues, even though her parents did everything in their power to get her to go. Well, it won't be that long.

This will be my shortest Thanksgiving visit to be honest, two days of travel, leaving only three days of time to actually do stuff. I'm taking Southwest by the way, it'll be my first time riding with this airline and I've heard a lot of good things about it. My boarding pass was promptly printed out at 12:01 according to the airline's directions so I can get the best seat possible (hopefully the exit row). Now I'm pretty much just trying to pass time and **not** fall asleep. That would just be a complete disaster. I guess I'm not feeling that creative at this time of the night since I could be updating the portfolio section or adding some cues here and there, but nope. There's always time for that.

In other news, I attended my first "formal" presentation for the design firm. We had a rocky start this morning and Joe literally said that I had to get my shit together. But it was my first time doing this, pretty much 98% of my clients up until today were strictly online, so I guess I left more room for mistakes than he did. All in all, it was a great presentation and I feel the Providence Business Improvement District will pick us to create Providence's new brand. We're in the running that's for sure.

Finally, I logged on to UConnect, the my grades were good. Want to see?

One trimester down, two to go. May 21, here I come.

PS: A quick thank you to the people on a certain Norwegian hardware and software forum. I appreciate the compliments, even though I had to read it in broken English. That's one of the funniest parts of the business, finding information about you in a different language and wondering what the bloody hell their trying to say.
