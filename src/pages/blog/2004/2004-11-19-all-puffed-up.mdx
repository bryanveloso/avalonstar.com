Two cuties from the land of the rising sun with two extremely high voices have finally made their way to the states in full force. These are the girls of [Puffy AmiYumi][1]. If you've watched "[Teen Titans][2]", they sang the very catchy intro.

Tonight their new show on Cartoon Network, aptly named "[Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi][3]" premiered, and hopefully to great reviews. I loved the show myself, but then again I'm a big fan of cartoons. I really hope that Cartoon Network keeps their paws to themselves. After ruining their logo and creating some of their own really [**bad** shows][4], they better not do anything to make this show bad.

But don't think that these two are new to the scene, they have been a major hit in their home country and have been frequent guests on shows like "[Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ][5]", and recently performed on that show's 10th Anniversary with one of their first hits from 1996. (a show that personally I love watching with Jenni even though I have no clue what their talking about). "Hey! Hey! Hey!" a vareity show that only works in Japan. I couldn't see something that funny here in the states, it's something about the english language.

So in concluding my daily spell of Japanese culture, I suggest that you check the show out, and the sites that I've linked to as well. I'm sure with an open mind you'll have a lot of fun with this.

PS: If you're in the mood for seeing one of my **favorite** cartoons, check out the Emmy-award winning [Samurai Jack][6].
