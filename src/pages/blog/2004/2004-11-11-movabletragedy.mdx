Taking a break from cleaning, I found that if you were to delcare the following: `border-top: 1px dotted #666;`, it produces different results in IE6 and Firefox. Firefox renders the border as it should be, dotted. On the other hand, IE6 messes it up by showing it as a dashed line. Normally I wouldn't really mind, but since dotted lines are what I wanted for the site, I had to settle with a background image for most of the borders. That's the first thing, and that's my contribution to the ever saturated web standards world.

Next, I got my first taste of comment spam yesterday. It really sucks when you finally get hit, because you feel so happy that people commented on your items only to find out that you were being solicited by poker bots. Thankfully, by finding [Elise Bauer's][1] article concerning this type of spam and how to deal with it. I also went ahead and installed [MT-Blacklist][2] which should hopefully take care of everything else for now. <del>While in the plugin mood, I also found the time to install [Daring Fireball's][3] [Markdown script][4].</del> <ins>Unfortunately, it looks like my server isn't configured for it. Oh well.</ins>

While browsing around today, I found MSN and their [beta edition search engine][5] (Bah only 10 pages of results). Taking it for a spin I found a site, [The Thousand][6] that had linked Autobiographical Emissions (my claim to fame, I guess) and had this to say about it:

> avalonstar: you've gotta love his tag line, "where designers treat each other like human beings." Awesome personal site by Bryan Veloso. He comes across as a guy sincerely trying to do his part to make the online design community a better place, not by being vocal, but by doing what he loves to do and recognizing others who do the same. More power to him.

I miss that tagline. Still holds true today, it just goes to show you that although the Internet can drastically change in a two year timespan, people can take a hell of a lot longer to catch up.

And finally for this entry, can one get tired of a song after listening to it for 200 times? I guess that fact holds true, for me at least.
