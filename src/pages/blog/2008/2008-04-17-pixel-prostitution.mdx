My good friend [Croftie][1] posted this this morning (links to individual tweets are in the footnotes):

> Ever had a client take your design, "rework it" and send it back to you so you can do the rest of the site their way? How did you handle it?[^1] I don't want to be someone's pixel prostitute. If they want to push my pixels around, they can do it themselves, after I'm done.[^2] My job is to give them the best possible solution I can come up with. They don't have to use it if they don't want to.[^3] It's work for hire. They hire us, we do our best, we give it to them. PERIOD. If they want to redesign it AFTER that, fine.[^4]

To answer the question simply. **Yes.** I have experienced that. We could leave the entry at that, but that wouldn't be me. ;)

## Oh look, there's blood. :O

To be honest, I was naive little bastard who didn't know how to say stop. I took beatings from clients more often than the nearest high school's stereotypical wimp. Granted, Don't get me wrong, I've [had some][2] [awesome][4] [clients][5], but as they always say, it's the little things that get to you. So I can empathize with Jeff. I have his back even because I know what this feels like. What I have learned through all of this, is that this business *requires a backbone*. I've learned that the hard way, obviously, but I had [people tell me][6] that this *wasn't* the way to do things.

I've had clients that have taken my designs, opened up their copy of Photoshop, "tweaked" said designs and send them back to me. Was I offended? Yeah, I was. Did I do anything about it? No. It didn't feel right to yell at a client for opening up Photoshop. It didn't feel right to yell at the person paying me. I had no backbone, I didn't take any recourse, and I was beating myself over the head with a mythological hammer created by both.

Oh, and then there's [Flock][7]. [Matt][8] and I still mourn that loss.

I know I've said this before somewhere--maybe here--but just because you are paid to do your job, it *does not mean* you are a slave to, or in Jeff's case, a pixel prostitute for the client.

## But wait, who are you to give any advice on the matter?

But what's this? Advice coming from a guy who can't even make ends meet some months? Yes, *laugh*, get it out. But this guy is looking out for yours and his own sanity. I would rather take one client a year and have awesome relationship with them where I can have free reign over the creative, then suffer financially; instead of taking clients and subsequently risk getting abused **just** to make ends meet. (If you see "the man" as a client, that's pretty much the reason [Facebook][9] and [Automattic][10] failed for me--restriction.)

That's not the way I roll and I'm happier for it. I get the phone calls and the letters. **This is my life.** Jen and I wouldn't have it any other way.

## So here's the moral of the story.

What Jeff wrote today really struck a chord with me, and I didn't feel my answer could be a simple "yes," nor would it fit in 140 characters. But here's the moral of the story, and I'll prefix with "if you're comfortable with it."

A client comes to you, looking for **your** expertise. They pay you for that expertise. Whether or not you stand up to them is your prerogative, but **you** are the expert. Remember that.

In a perfect world, we'd all spew our collective creative genius on the web and consequently the web would be a much more beautiful place. It isn't, but it shouldn't mean that we can't **fight for it**.

*If you're comfortable doing so*, when you see the red flags go off, **do something about it**. Pull the client aside and give them the what for and if that doesn't work, fire them. **Do not** put your own sanity and self-confidence at risk if **you don't have to**. Give your expertise to the clients who respect you, the clients who deserve your knowledge and experience.

Or... you could just spend your days making your own stuff. :)
