To those that told me that squatters don't permanently keep a name all the time - you're right and I owe you one. I'm kind of at a loss here, because I did manage to keep the backorder on since I didn't have any others I wanted to transfer it to. For the people tracking this lunacy, it went through three squatters before finally becoming available. Actually, I had emailed GoDaddy support last night because there was a discrepancy with the whois information. At first, it wasn't available, and then it said that GoDaddy owned it. Now, I see that it was the backordering taking effect.

Well. It's not often that I look like **this** much of a fool. But thanks for your confidence everybody. Since I have about 4 other domains I'm preparing for launch in a few weeks, I can't tell you what I'm going to do with this one, but you'll see. ;)

More from Avalonstar in the coming weeks as well, it's just been really _really_ busy on the business side. Again, I do apologize for my bickering. ^_^;
