Well, it was inevitable right? Thanks to [Paul Stamatiou][1], I got my very own meme to fill out since the good 'ol book one. Who knows how long this little leg of the meme has been going on, nobody ever knows where they start anyway. Hopefully you'll learn a little more about me, but for a lot of you, this is pretty obvious information. Don't worry though, I'll be back to my regularly scheduled blogging stint tomorrow.
