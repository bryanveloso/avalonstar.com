Jen and I were talking about Christmas presents in the car tonight as we were starting our shopping and draining our wallets. We bought a few things at Best Buy, struck a few people from our list and went on from there. Then on the way home, the question I feared (yes, feared) came up: "now what would you like for Christmas," in so many words.

## What's your problem with presents?

None, actually. I love presents. But, when it comes to people asking me what I want for a certain holiday or occasion I usually clam up and get all indecisive. Not that I'm indecisive already, but I get **really** indecisive. After a splattering of "um's" and "hmm's", Jen brought up something that I had wanted for a while but just couldn't afford. That my friends, was the wonderful Apple 30" Cinema Display. But this isn't where the story ends folks, not at all.

## Here's the dilemma.

About halfway home, Jen brought up that I had also wanted a Mac Pro when they first came up. Obviously, I started dreaming about how great it would be to have this really powerful machine sitting at my feet. But then I thought, "oh crap, but I won't be able to take it anywhere." It's that age-old question my friends.

**Laptop or Desktop?**
I've heard all the arguments, and have actually been with either platform long enough to get a feel for myself. Power or portability? It just confuses the hell out of me when I think about it. We brought up a number of reasons that weren't normal ones. For instance, how Apple has a leasing program so I could trade in a laptop after a certain amount of time and get a new one. Or on that same argument, with a desktop I won't have to worry about hitting it's limits (especially with those Mac Pros, yum).

## So what's the answer?

I don't have one yet. Obviously we're going to have to save up if I want one of these, but unfortunately, living in the most expensive area in the nation for middle-class folk doesn't help. The fall back, obviously, is the Cinema Display, since I could use that with my current Automattic laptop, or a shiny new desktop. But is that really the smartest decision? I guess I'm not looking for a definitive answer, but more views from the gallery.

Well.. at least I thought this was worth asking all you Avalonstar lovelies. ;)
