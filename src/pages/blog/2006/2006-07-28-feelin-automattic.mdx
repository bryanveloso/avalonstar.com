**Conferences** and **connections** spawn everything. I've come to that conclusion.

*   [South by Southwest][1] spawned [Revyver][2].
*   [WebVisions][3] spawned what I'm about to tell you.

What started out as an email tip from a friend, turned into an opportunity I **could not** miss. I stared at that email when I got it, for a long while actually. About this time, the company was preparing to hit it's first low streak - you know, trying to find clients, telling clients to get moving, etc. Still staring at that email, I thought: WordPress. Woah.

So I replied. Then I sent my [LinkedIn][4] link and my [CarbonMade][5] portfolio. After two "interviews", one in Portland and the other in San Francisco, and a [quick test][6] - the [very sharp] Matt Mullenweg, along with <a href="http://boren.nu" rel="colleague met">Ryan Boren</a>, his wife and [their lovely dog Anya][7], welcomed me as the eighth member of [Automattic][8].

So, why? Well. WordPress. Akismet. bbPress. Etc. Do you blame me? This was an opportunity I could not miss, to take a pro-active position as a designer and developer of the **only** blogging software I would **ever** use. As [Will Pate][9] said to me, "it was a match made in heaven." Revyver isn't dead, not by a long shot. Only difference being that I won't be trying to get 3-5 clients a month to keep myself afloat. TutorialMonitor is still happening, nothing's really changed on that end. I just couldn't miss this, and I would have *sincerely* regretted it if I did.

So what's next? Who knows? I can hear the whispers people wanting to see [pieces of sheet metal being launched][10], but there's still a lot to be done on that end. All I have to say is that the journey starts once again. It's going to be an awesome ride, <del>and yes, I'll see you at <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamp</a>.</del>
