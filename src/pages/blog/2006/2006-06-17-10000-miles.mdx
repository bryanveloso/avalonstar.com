Seems like a bunch of things are happening on the same day. :)

At about 6:35 PM in Beaumont, CA, I hit my 10,000th mile with the RX-8. Given that I bought the car on the 25th of November, it's been 175 days (almost to the minute!). Time for the stats!

+  **Average Miles Per Day**: 57
+  **Average Miles Per Month**: 1,714
+  **Anticipated Reading on 11/25/2006**: 20,857 (looks like I'm lying on my insurance o_o)
+  **Major Modifications**: 2 (Cold Air Intake, Strut Bar)
+  **Minor Modifications**: 2 (Screen Protectors, Trunk Organizer)
+  **Useless Purchases**: _at least_ 1 (Tire Valve Caps)
+  **Car Wash Visits**: _at least_ 30
+  **Times Waxed**: _about_ 3
+  **Number of Dealer Visits**: _around_ 15
+  **Number of Ricer Kills**: _Too many to count._
+  **Times I Hit Redline**: 10 (way too little)

All I have to say is that this has been the funnest 10,000 miles I've ever had with a car. The last two cars I hit this mark with were a 1989 Toyota Camry and a 1988 Mitsubishi Starion. Here's to another 10,000!
