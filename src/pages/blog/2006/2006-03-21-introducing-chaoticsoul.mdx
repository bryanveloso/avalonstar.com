Hah, I can hear the Avalonstar fans of yesteryear rejoice. But no, [this is not the return of the famed 12th version][1] to this domain, but rather, a port to a WordPress theme. I don't think I could have ever seen myself releasing a theme, but the time has come for me to bring back one of my favorite versions of Avalonstar. Now, it's for your use instead of mine.

This has been a great nostalgic project at the least, since I was able to revisit my old code and laugh at my old process. But enough of this reminiscing. What you see here is by no means a final version, but whether or not I iterate on this is left to be determined. Because I haven't tested this in IE, even though this is a 1.0, treat it like it's an alpha. I really just wanted to get this out and into your hands to play with. I'm sure it at least degrades gracefully in all those trashy browsers. ;)

Okay, bugs. How well this is received will choose the bug reporting route I take, but for now just keep the bugs coming to my email or the comments below. Either way I hope you like it. Finally, a [special thanks to Phu][3] for inspiring me to do this. Let me know if you use it!
