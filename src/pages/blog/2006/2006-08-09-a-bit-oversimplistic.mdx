(or _The Making of [bryanveloso.com][1]_)

"Boxes. Yeah, I'll do boxes," I said to myself yesterday. About fifteen minutes later, I had finished. Well, let me give you some background first. A lot of you know that I finally acquired my name after almost having it slip away from me at the hands of domain squatters. Needless to say, I was freakishly excited when I got it. However, all of that freakish excitement faded away after I sat down to think about what I'd do with it. So I thought, well, what do other people do with their names?

Most people use them for their blogs. Shaun Inman, Garrett Dimon, Molly Holzschlag, Cameron Moll - just to name a few. Remember their names and you'll remember where their blogs are.

No. I could never move Avalonstar to [bryanveloso.com][1], that'd be... **boring**.

So that brought me back to square one, what to do with it. So I thought, why not aggregate all of the stuff that makes me up, and I started to do that. I took feeds from Avalonstar and Live From the 101. But then I thought, well, anybody know knows who I am will already know about these two sites. Ultimately, it was scrapped. My next idea was, to have my "life's" story on there. Examples being: how I met Jenni, how I got three cats, etc. And I started to write too, a lot. But then I got to the part about high school and felt that I could write a whole autobiography, so I stopped there and never went back to it. Just the thought of writing grammatically incorrect paragraphs en masse really scared me. So it sat there.

Which brings us back to yesterday, when I thought, "Boxes." My website should be about me, right? About who I am, and what makes me up. It's sort of like answering a question. Somebody types a name into their browser bar to see who they are. I thought I'd answer that question. Really simply by listing everything that I am. The big thing is that I wanted this done quickly, no overly complex design. I mean, this is for me. I'm not expecting any awards or acclimations for this site. If people want to know what's there, now they have their answer.
