Talk about thinking I'd never talk about Linux, Unix or any *nix in this place - but behold, the power of the MacBook Pro and [Parallel's Virtual Machine][1] have granted me the key to the world of Linux.

## So, some history.

I was never always a Macintosh user, nor have I ever touched a build of Linux before about a year ago. Yes, I was a Windows user, happily designing in Windows XP. That's an oxymoron to most people, as it is to me now. But about a year ago, three things happened. I was able to get a free miniMac from the old [Gratis Networks (now FreePay)][2], and I had signed myself up onto one of [Media Temple's][3] lovely [Dedicated-Virtual servers][4] (herein referred to as (dv)). For those that have read [my (mt) writings in the past][5], you'll already know that a vanilla (dv) installation has Red Hat Linux Enterprise 3. The third event that took place was that I got the job at Facebook, a company that has always been <acronym title="Linux, Apache, mySQL, PHP">LAMP</acronym>-based.

Before about six months ago, I had never touched the command line. It was because of Facebook that I learned PHP, and it was also because of Facebook that I started my journeys into Linux-land. Things went downhill from there as I tried, unsuccessfully, to install PHP5 on my (dv) using the `RPM` and `yum` programs. Which is why, to this day, I have never written part 2 of my Media Temple series. However, after getting a fresh start and some help from the lovely admins at (mt), I was able to start small. Fast forward to after the [CSSReboot][6], and I was back to playing with my server again at the hands of my "rival" [Jeff Croft][7], this time, upgrading Python so I could install [Django][8]. I was able to successfully build both Python and then later Subversion. At the same time, I had requested a MacBook Pro and started playing around with Parallels.

## What's Next?

What? Am I still a designer you say? Of course! But I'm starting to find myself jumping head first into this stuff. Right now I'm playing with both Fedora Core 5 and Ubuntu, and if virtualization gets fast enough, I might even host my development server there. Why? Well, because it would probably help me learn Linux a bit more. Updates to come as I start to get the hang of this.

But here's a question as I close this entry, what would you recommend a Linux noob such as myself to do? (I'm sure it'll help those who aren't as explicit as I as well.)
