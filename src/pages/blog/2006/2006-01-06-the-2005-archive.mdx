**7** unfinished sites, **1** weird logo, **1** brochure, **1** book, **20** photoshop files, **263.7** megabytes of art and design goodness. **85.2** megabytes of stuff after compression.

Welcome to the 2005 archive, now with a full helping of Adobe and coding goodness - all available in a 85.2MB ZIP file (there goes my damn bandwidth). I've decided to mix it up a little bit, including some InDesign documents of a brochure I made, as well as a small book I put together. There are a bunch more blank Avalonstar templates and some other ones yet to be announced. That'll explain why some of these are so empty, but those are the ones I encourage you to take and play with.

Again, not many people would go ahead and do this, but I thought that I'd put some of these old files to work rather than have them sit around waiting for my next drive to crash. Download this knowing the above facts. I really don't want to be extending my generosity only to find people killing something I gave for free. Makes sense right? Thought so. [Download it here][1], and enjoy. Don't say I didn't warn you.

**So spread the word! And kill my bandwidth![^1]**
