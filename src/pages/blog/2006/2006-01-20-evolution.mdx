Well, thankfully, I just evolved past this damn stomach flu - but that's not what this is about. If it were only that easy to just have a cold once, and then evolve from it - but again I should stop talking about that. Yesterday, before I sent myself home from work once again to prevent the inoculation of my disease to the innocent still left, I was browsing around my old LiveJournal accounts. To give you a little background on just how long I have been doing any sort of writing, my first entry on my first LiveJournal account was written on April 7, 2001; and it went something like this:

> Hey, wow... this is different. Never had an online journal before. My sister recommended that I should get this, so I can bitch all I want. So that's what I will do. If you are here from avalonstar.com, welcome. If not, welcome anyway. I hope you enjoy learning about my life, and soon, you will know me more than I do... scratch that... that's a scary thought. Ok, back to the drawing board.
Mind you, I was listening to Limp *Bizkit* and feeling creative at the time, but nevertheless looking at that yesterday took me back quite a bit. Not only that, but as I went through that old piece of history, I found myself gawking at some of the things I had written. Phrases that really felt they either came from the heart or out of my ass, either way, I experienced the "I said that?" feeling. The funny thing was, it intrigued me to go on to see what things I did write about years ago. It seems like I was very free using language that I thought illustrated my point, whether that language was proper or vulgar. But to think that it was only 4 years ago, at times it was so embarrassing that I was glad that it wasn't material I had shown on any other public site. I sounded like such an idiot. Does this sound familiar at all?

I guess it shows how we all evolve through our phases in maturity and writing. Also - purpose. I guess our demeanor changes as our purpose for writing changes. I'm sure this blog would be a whole lot more informal if I was writing about how much I hate life. But I don't, so I don't. What I am interested in, is what other parallel instances (if any) lie out there. I'd love to hear about them.

**And no, I am not going to tell you guys where the journal I got that quote from is.**
