So. Hi everybody.

## I got some lovely mail today.

> "You're too lazy to design."
> "You're jumping on a bandwagon."
> "Why are you making your readers suffer?"
> "You're just doing this for 'link love'."
> "This is like not being away and leaving your AIM away message up."
> "This idea is retarded, you must be proud."
>
## And then I reacted.

All I have to say is, wow. A lot of people decided to kick **themselves** in the asses this morning. I come home from a great movie (it was Stranger Than Fiction by the way, really good flick, I highly recommend it.) and vicious man-eating reptiles start leaping at my poor site. You know, usually I wouldn't just come out and say something like this, but **what the hell** and ... o_O?!? Why are the lot of you such haters? This is not some ploy, this is not the reincarnation of CSS Naked Day, this is not me riding a bandwagon. This is a designer, me, wanting to redesign his **personal** site and thinking the best way to do it is by stripping it. Is that so **hard to understand**?

\*sigh\* In so many words, I had a lot more to say.

To those who decided to leave those lovely messages, the least you could do is... nevermind.

## Ahem, remember the golden rule!

Oh but, to those who are still reading, remind me to put a "mind your manners" warning when I'm redesigning. However, I'm sure all these lovely comments from faithful readers who leave email addresses like *fuckedupidea@dumbass.com* will get me back into shape.

Oh that's what I wanted to say, if you're going to leave a comment and a contrary one at that, have the decency to leave an email address. A **working** email address. What are you afraid of? Oh well.

Thanks, now back to your regularly scheduled spam outbreak.
