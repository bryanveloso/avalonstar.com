Last night I had the distinct pleasure of meeting the three guys behind [ParticleTree][1], [Treehouse Magazine][2] and the upcoming <del>Woofu</del>[Wufoo][3] - Kevin Hale, Chris Campbell and Ryan Campbell. We ate at a Chili's in Mountain View where I had a delicious bacon burger. I learned a bunch of things as well. Ryan is an avid gamer, as we talked about our love of Square and Final Fantasy while Chris (who hates working for "the man") and Kevin (who happens to know a lot more than I do about JSON) were confused as hell. This event was flipped by the way, when Kevin brought up XSL(S)(whatever) and JSON and totally shot a topic over my head.

Anyway, this has nothing to do with anything, other than the fact that I also had the great pleasure of being interviewed by them for their most recent (and last for a while) issue of Treehouse Magazine. It was quite an honor to be picked as my babbling would join the ranks of other Treehouse interviewees, including [SI][4], [JSM][5] and [JF][6]. I have to say, they did come very close to stumping me with a few of the questions and I think you'll realize which ones fall under that category. All in all, I enjoyed being interviewed and I hope that you'll enjoy reading it.

[You can grab this month's issue][2], which also includes some great articles about how to create a blog with Javascript as well as one on doing business taxes. Although I know you're only going there to read my rambilings. ;)

If you literally can't wait until that lovely PDF downloads, here's a teaser for you:

> **What is the story behind the name of your blog, Avalonstar?**
>
> Ah! That's a story filled with wizardry, courage and lore. No, I'm lying. Really. Back in 2000, after I had begged my father to buy me my first domain name, I had the challenge of trying to come up with one. I knew it probably would stay with me for a long time, as I was "too poor" to buy any others. Coincidentally, at the time, there were two new cars that were either entering the market or being redesigned. Those were the *Toyota Avalon* and the *Oldsmobile Alero*. Obviously, after a lot of thinking, I went with *Avalon* over *Alero*. The *star* part sounded nice at the end with also leads me to say that I completed the name while in my high school astronomy class. Nope, there's no "Mists of Avalon" or "Gargoyles" story here folks. I named my website after a car. But who knew I would have stayed with it for so long.

Okay, most of you know that story already. But hey, I can't be giving the meat away! Silly kids.
