While other people were busy at [Barcamp][1], I found something else to do - drive. If I could give any little piece of advice when it comes to taking the next step with your car, don't even make it a mod, just meet people who are just as passionate about it as you are. For me, that was finding [RX8Club][2] and mingling with the people there. I learned that by joining the right forums, you can learn multitudes about your car that no car show or manual can tell you.

Well, my participation in the community led up to my first ever car meet. If you were to take a bunch of rotary powered cars and stuff them into a parking lot in Treasure Island and that would only tell half the story. I was joined today by [Paul Stamatiou][3], [Phil Freo][4] and [Dimitry Bentsionov][5] (whom I all hope had a great time). To make the long story short, I picked them up at 11:00 AM, went to Milpitas, took part in a 15-20 rotary car caravan up to Treasure Island, and finally had the time of my life looking at what people could do to their cars.

I'll leave you with that and [I'll let **all of the** pictures do the talking.][7] Now, your homework: go find the official forum for your car and start talking, and if you don't learn anything new about it, then I'll be pretty surprised (I would have bet money, but that would have gotten dirty).
