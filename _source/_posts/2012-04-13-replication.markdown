Good artists copy, great artists steal. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Clichés we've come to know and love. For what seems like an eternity now, I've been encouraging people trying to get into our field to get into the practice of replicating. When used as a learning tool, replication can be an invaluable teacher and an invaluable motivator.

So this week on the hastily-named-but-I-sort-of-like-it-now Vlogalonstar: _Replication_.

(This time I managed to talk slower and keep everything under the 4 minute mark. Next time I hope to talk about something a little less... teachy. That is, unless you'd all like me to keep being all... teachy. I can go either way with this.)
