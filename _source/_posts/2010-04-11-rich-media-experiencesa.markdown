You know what?

I want to make Rich Magical Motion-erific "In Your Faceâ„¢" Multi-Media Experiencesâ„¢ for the Webâ„¢ *without* having to use Adobe's Flash. Screw DHTML. I want things to fly around exactly like they do on [The FWA][1]. So they should look exactly like ones made in Flash, but I *don't* want to use Flash.

Oh, wait, I *have* to use Flash?

There's no... compile HTML to Flash or anything?

I guess I should throw a hissy fit then, it's going to hurt my business.
