summary: "This is the story of a guy and a game. Said guy loves the concept of said game, even though it's still a work in progress. Well, with the permission of the developer of said game, said guy made some ringtones for your iPhone."

It's no surprise that I love [Mimeo][1][^1]. Everything about it, even in its work-in-progress state, hits numerous points of interest for me in my eternal love of the video game--a detailed environment, a monumental plot and most importantly, knee-jerk-reaction-inducing music.

Rarely do I listen to a soundtrack out of context and immediately fall in love with it, but I guess that's just the normal reaction to anything [Shaun][2] [makes][3] [these][4] [days][5] isn't it? So when I was searching for some new 8-bit ringtones to rudely awaken me, I thought, why not have Mimeo wake me up? The buildups from 2-bit to 16-bit resolutions make the tracks perfect for waking people up.

So with Shaun's blessing I made some quick iPhone ringtones. Unfortunately (and obviously... I guess) since since ringtones can only be 40 seconds long, the resolution changes every 8 beats. So below are the <del>three</del><ins>four</ins> tracks that Shaun has released thus far in `.m4r` format[^2].

* [Fortress][6]
* [Jaunt][7]
* [King][12]
* [Under][8]

Remember: *right-click* and save! If you have any problems, feel free to [@reply][11] me, but things should be pretty straightforward.

[^1]: If you haven't heard of Mimeo, [I suggest you read a little bit][1] about it and watch the video at the bottom of Shaun's post.
[^2]: I just realized that [he also released][9] "[King][10]", <del>so I'll get to that one too since I have a gigantic weak spot for boss music.</del>
