This is it.
This is the culmination of the last four years.
This is the end of one more chapter in my life and the start of another.
This is where I find true freedom.
This is day one of the rest of my life.

**To all the graduates of the class of 2005, congratulations. We're done!**

(Hey, I said I wouldn't write about this anymore, but come on - can you blame me?)
